.TP 30
\fBinit\fP \fIdevice xmin xmax ymin ymax\fP
Name of graphics device and optional parameters, if any choice 
at all, and the graphics plotting area in cm. (Standard plotting
area is 20cm by 20cm).
.TP
\fBstop\fP 
Close graphics device.

.TP
\fBltype\fP \fIwidth pattern\fP
0 will not change the current value. \fIwidth\fP: 1 thin and increasing
thickness. \fIpattern\fP: 1 is solid, subsequents are graphics device
dependant, but typically dashed, dotted etc.

.TP
\fBline\fP \fIx y\fP
Draw a line from current point to \fI(x,y)\fP [units in cm]

.TP
\fBmove\fP \fIx y\fP
Move the current point to \fI(x,y)\fP [units in cm]

.TP
\fBcolor\fP \fIi\fP
Set current color from 0 to plncolors-1 (an integer)

.TP
\fBpoint\fP \fIa b\fP
Draw a point at \fI(x,y)\fP [units in cm]

.TP
\fBcircle\fP \fIx y s\fP
Draw a circle at \fI(x,y)\fP with size \fIs\fP [units in cm]

.TP
\fBcross\fP \fIx y s\fP
Draw a cross at \fI(x,y)\fP with size \fIs\fP [units in cm]

.TP
\fBbox\fP \fIx y s\fP
Draw a square box at \fI(x,y)\fP with size \fIs\fP [units in cm]

.TP
\fBjust\fP \fIi\fP
Set text justification to \fIi\fP. -1 is left, 0 centered,
and +1 right justified.

.TP
\fBtext\fP \fIs x y h a\fP
Plot a string \fItext\fP (enclose in double quotes if spaces
are required) at \fI(x,y)\fP with character height \fIh\fP
[all units in cm] and at angle \fIa\fP degrees,
counterclockwise from the positive X-axis.

.TP
\fB#\fP
A comment.

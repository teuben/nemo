.TH BENCH 5NEMO "31 August 2023"

.SH "NAME"
bench \- various NEMO benchmarks

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
/usr/bin/time $NEMO/src/scripts/nemo.bench
make -f Benchfile clean all
nemobench COMMAND
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
There are several methods to compare the performance of NEMO on different processors or environments:

.RS 2
.IP 1.
The command \fBmake bench\fP from the $NEMO directory runs a standard benchmark of about a dozen 
selected NEMO programs.  It should run in about 30 seconds on a ~2020 computer. A short
table (see below in RESULTS) lists results from some recent computers.

.IP 2.
The command \fBmake bench5\fP from the $NEMO directory runs a standard benchmark of (currently) 6
nbody runs, all calibrated to take 5 seconds on a specific machine. the average of those will
result in a rating (speed) of 1000. Most machines post ~2020 should get a \fInemobench5\fP (SEE BELOW)
of over 1000.


.IP 3.
Various \fBBenchfile\fP filles scattered through the $NEMO source tree contain benchmarks. There is
no  wrapper like "make check" has for Testfile's

.IP 4.
Selected man pages have some examples. Over time these should be moved into the Benchfile in
the source directory where this program is maintained. Some are mentioned below in this man page.

.SH "NEMOBENCH5"

The NEMOBENCH5 benchmark (cd $NEMO;make bench5) runs a number (currently 6) N-body codes all calibrated to
take 5.0 seconds on an i5-1135G7 in turbo mode (4.2GHz). The NEMOBENCH5 rating
is defined as 5000 divided by the average of those CPU times. Thus the i5-1135G7 has
a score of 1000.  This definition can be adjusted to 10s runs when the time comes that processors
run too fast, there is a parameter internal to the nemo.bench script, and could also
be adjusted if more codes are used.

where on this particular CPU there is a diversity of speeds. Some CPU show even more diversity.

.PP
Here is an example how to use nemobench5 is parallel mode on a 32 core Xeon, where a single NEMOBENCH5 has a score of 630.
Since all codes are single core, gnu parallel is used to run them in parallel, which should scale linearly as long as memory
is not exhausted (this particular CPU has 512GB memory):

Keep in mind for most of these a default compilation was used.  Some benchmarks are known
to be able to improved by up to a factor of two with selected compiler and options changes.


.PP
The following tasks are run in the standard NEMO bench, for details see the
src/scripts/nemo.bench  script.
.nf

.fi
In addition each data file that is produced is checksummed and compared
to a baseline version using \fIbsf(1NEMO)\fP if the argument
\fBbsf=1\fP is added.

.SH "BENCH8"
The \fBbench8\fP measures how well your CPU performs simple OpenMP algorithm
as more cores are employed. This can be an effective way to determine how
well your CPU adjusts under increased power demands, for example laptops with
thermal protection will scale down their cpu frequency as more cores are
employed.

.nf

   scaling2 umax=20000 np=2 iter=40
   scaling2 umax=20000 np=4 iter=80
.fi

Look at the elapsed time to follow how well a particular CPU performs at increased load:

.fi



.SH "BENCH10"
Not really implemented, but this will be benchmarks orchestrated via the \fBBenchfile\fP's
found in the source tree.

.SH "OLDEST BENCH"
At the inception of NEMO in 1986 there was no real benchmark, so for a while (as computers
were relatively slow still) we used the default \fIhackcode1(1NEMO)\fP setting, where 128 particles
in virial equilibrium are integrated for 64 timesteps:
.nf

      /usr/bin/time hackcode1 tstop=2  > /dev/null
.fi

.PP
On a Sun 3/50 (our development machine) this took about 5 seconds per step.
Now, nearly 35 years later, my laptop runs this about 50,000 times faster.
Looking in more detail at the original NEMO manual:

.nf
.ta +1i
                       cpu/steps
sun 3/60:  20 MHz	2.28        
i5-1135G7: 4200 MHz	0.0000875   

.fi
Despite that the cpu was 210 times faster, the code ran 26,000 faster. A very impressive
factor of 120 improvement in chip and possibly some compiler technology. The NEMO users
guide has an appendix in which this benchmark is listed for a variety of computers
since 1986.

.SH "CAVEATS"
Defining and running a benchmark can be very tricky stuff. It might be
important to separate disk I/O from CPU usage.   The unix \fItime(1)\fP 
command can be a help. The output from bash::time is a bit different
form csh::time, and yet different from /usr/bin/time. Unless you find
a special one, we prefer the csh::time, since the output clearly
separates user, system and wall clock time, and also reports the I/O, viz.
.nf
   % time ls 
   0.012u 0.068s 0:00.77 9.0%	0+0k 8376+0io 0pf+0w
   2.324u 1.080s 0:09.25 36.7%	0+0k 1049384+2097160io 2pf+0w
   1.876u 0.788s 0:03.63 73.0%	0+0k 0+2097160io 0pf+0w
.fi
On linux the command 
.nf
   echo 1 > > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
.fi
will clear the disk cache in memory, so your program will be forced to read
from disk, with all possible interference from other programs
.PP
In NEMO another useful addition to the benchmark is that the output can be
turned off easily, by using \fBout=.\fP, viz.
.nf
    % sudo $NEMO/src/scripts/clearcache
    % time ccdsmooth n1 . dir=x
    0.852u 1.068s 0:12.41 15.3%	0+0k 2098312+0io 6pf+0w
    0.812u 0.400s 0:01.21 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
    0.820u 0.380s 0:01.20 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
.fi
where the last two instances were just re-running the same command, but
now clearly showing the effect of reading the file from memory instead
of disk. By repeating this whole series a few times, an lower bound to the 
wall clock time is more likely to properly account for the I/O overhead time.
.PP
Rule of thumb: always run a benchmark a few times to see if a hot CPU slows
down the benchmark. If I/O is cached. Other tasks are interfering.

.SH  "OTHERS"
A few other man pages in NEMO also maintain their own list how its program compares under different compilers/options/cpu options:
.nf
.ta +1i
\fICGS(1NEMO)\fP
\fIscfm(1NEMO)\fP
.fi
.PP
Other industry benchmarks:
.nf
    Geekbench 5 (very wide variety of compute workloads - baseline is i3-8100)
    Linpack   (focus on floating point operations - Gflops)
    SPEC CPU 2017 ($$$) benchmark - 
.fi

.SH "TABBENCH"
The table I/O benchmark uses a 100M row dataset with 3 columns,
representing X,Y,Z of which the radius R=sqrt(X^2+Y^2+Z^2) is computed. This table
is about 2.7 GB in size.
Of course reading the table is all dependent on the HDD/SDD, but in the case described here
this was a fast SSD, and took 2 sec to read, or just over 1000 MB/sec.
.nf

    /usr/bin/time tabgen tab3 100000000 3
    /usr/bin/time tabbench2 . mode=-1
    
.nf
this bench will need to be repeated for mode=0,1,2,3 to estimate the different components as they
are added to the workflow. The \fItabgen(1NEMO)\fP is dominated by
drawing random numbers and writing them using \fIprintf(3)\fP , which is slow.

.nf
    80s   writing, using tabgen
     2s   reading in tabbench2
    22s   parsing in numbers  [np.loadtxt takes 748 sec!!!]
     6s   using \fIfie(3NEMO)\fP to compute radii
     1s   using np.sqrt(), and presumably C's sqrt() as well
    
.fi

.SH "PARALLEL"
The GNU \fIparallel(1)\fP
tool can be of great use if your tasks are pure single core and you have enough cores (most laptops have at least 4 these days)
and memory to fit your tasks.   As an example, here is something contrived using \fImkplummer(1NEMO)\fP that does not write to disk,
so it should be highly parallizable:

.nf
    nbody=10000000
    /usr/bin/time mkplummer . $nbody
    \fB2.80user 0.45system 0:03.26elapsed 99%CPU\fP
    
    echo mkplummer . $nbody  > run.txt
    echo mkplummer . $nbody >> run.txt
    /usr/bin/time parallel --jobs 1 < run.txt
    \fB5.89user 0.83system 0:06.71elapsed 100%CPU\fP
    
    /usr/bin/time parallel --jobs 2 < run.txt
    \fB6.00user 0.79system 0:03.44elapsed 197%CPU\fP
.fi

which follows Amdahl's law close to 100%!


.SH "CONSIDERATIONS"
Most programs that need an output file, can use \fBout=-\fP to pass the data into a standard Unix pipe,
or even \fBout=.\fP to use a sink.

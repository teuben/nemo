.TH TESTFILE 5NEMO "28 March 2025" 
.SH "NAME"
Testfile \- a Makefile for regression testing

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
NEMO uses a \fBTestfile\fP in specific directories to orechestrate
a series of regression tests via the "make check" command.
A \fBTestfile\fP follows the Makefile (see \fImake(1)\fP) format.
In local directories one tyically does
.EX

    make -f Testfile clean all

.EE
to test and set up the tests.  An example of a test could be
the following make \fItarget\fP in the Testfile:
.EX

   mkplummer:
       mkplummer mkplummer.100 100 seed=123
       bsf mkplummer.100 test="0.00142653 0.648292 -4.67407 5.57043 701"
      
.EE
It is important to pick descriptive filenames, because these would show up
in the summary of "cd $NEMO; make check"  and help location the trouble spot.
The file \fI$NEMO/testsuite.log\fP also contains the output logs of running
the testsuite.

NEMO command line arguments do not need to be given if given in the correct order.
For example:
	mkplummer out=p10 nbody=10
can be 
	mkplummer p10 10

If you want to find out the order of the keywords, use the "help=" option
%
A unix pipe becomes a '-' in NEMO:

	mkplummer - 10 | tsf -

where the first '-' denotes 'stdout', and the secon 'stdin'.

%
Numbered file descriptors can also be used in NEMO, but only sh shells
(such as bash) support these, csh do not. Example:

	mkplummer p1 10
	mkplummer p2 10
	snapstack -3 -4 junk 3<p1 4<p2

but remember that 0,1, and 2 are reserved for stdin, stdout and stderr.
This scheme makes it possible to write much more complex
%
A nemo file can also be a URL, e.g.

	tsf http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo/p10k.dat
%
There are two kinds on help:
Online help:		man mkplummer
Inline help:		mkplummer help=h
%
The 'mknemo' command makes a very easy to recompile, or even update your
NEMO with new programs.
	mknemo 
%
For complicated procedures, the mknemo command uses a control file in
$NEMO/src/scripts/mknemo.d. E.g.
	mknemo gyrfalcON

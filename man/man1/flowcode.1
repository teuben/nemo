.TH FLOWCODE 1NEMO "11 April 1996"
.SH NAME
flowcode \- evolve an N-body system based on a given flow (2D only)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBflowcode\fP [\fIparameter\fP=\fIvalue\fP] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIflowcode\fP is an equal-timestep N-body integrator which evolves
the particles based on the computed flow (currently only in 2D) at
their current position.
The flow is obtained from a standard
potential descriptor, given by the three keywords
\fBpotname=,potpars=,potfile=\fP (See also \fIpotential(3,5NEMO)\fP),
except that flow velocity is returned instead of forces. The potential
itself has no meaning.
.PP
In addition to integrating the equations of motion, the particles
are allowed to loose some (\fBeta\fP) of their random energy (smoothed over
a certain ``box'' size (\fBcell\fP)), and turn it into mean orbital motion. 
.PP
Orbits can also be diffused: each timestep the velocity vector 
can be rotated over the randomly gaussian distributed angle (\fBsigma\fP).
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized; they may be given in any order.
.TP 24
\fBin\fP=\fIin-file\fP
Initial conditions will be read from \fIin-file\fP in snapshot format
[default: none - but is required].
.TP
\fBout\fP=\fIout-file\fP
If given, results are written to \fIout-file\fP in snapshot format
[default: empty, no snapshot output file produced].
.TP
\fBpotname=\fIname\fP
name of file of \fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP descriptor 
[default: \fBharmonic\fP].
.TP
\fPpotpars=\fIpar-list\fP
List of parameters to the potential descriptor. The first
parameter must be the pattern speed in the x-y plane,
although rotating frames of reference are not
yet supported. The remaining parameters are used by the
\fI_inipotential()\fP routine in the potential descriptor.
[default: none - let them be defined by routine itself].
.TP
\fBpotfile=\fIfile-name\fP
name of an optional datafile to the potential descriptor.
This might be an N-body snapshot or list of spline fit
coefficients etc. [default: none].
.TP
\fBsave\fP=\fIstate-file\fP
If given, the system state will be saved in \fIstate-file\fP after each
timestep. Useful for some recovery after system crashes.
.TP
\fBfreq\fP=\fIinteg-freq\fP
Inverse time-step, to be used with the time integrator.
[Default: \fB64.0\fP (64 steps per unit time)].
.TP
\fBmode\fP=\fImode-number\fP
Integration mode number: 0=simpel Eulerian, 
0=Euler, 
1=PC (Predictor Corrector) algorithm, 
2=modified PC algorithm, 
3=Runge-Kutta (JEB modified)
4=4th order Runge-Kutta.
[default: \fB3\fp].
.TP
\fBtstop\fP=\fIstop-time\fP
Time to stop integration in N-body model units.
Default is \fB2.0\fP.
.TP
\fBfreqout\fP=\fIout-freq\fP
Frequency of major N-body data outputs.
Default is \fB4.0\fP (4 frames per unit time).
.TP
\fBminor_freqout\fP=\fIout-freq\fP
Frequency of minor diagnostic outputs.
Default is \fB32.0\fP (32 diagnostic measurements per unit time).
.TP
\fBoptions\fP=\fIoption-string\fP
Miscellaneous control options, specified as a comma-separated list
of keywords.
Currently recognized keywords are:
\fBreset_time\fP: when reading initial data, set \fItnow\fP to zero;
\fBnew_tout\fP: when restarting, set new output times;
\fBmass\fP, \fBphi\fP, \fBacc\fP: output mass, potential,
acceleration data with major data outputs.
.TP
\fBeta\fP=\fIloss-fraction\fP
Fraction of random energy that is dissipated
[Default: \fB0.0\fP].
.TP
\fBcell\fP=\fIbox-size\fP
Cell size in which dissipation is performed after every timestep.
Dissipation is current performed on a cartesian grid, in which 
cells are square (2D) or a cube (3D).
[Default: \fB0.1\fP].
.TP
\fBrmax\fP=\fImax_box-size\fP
Maximum size of the "box" (actually cube) within which dissipation
is performed. If a negative number is given, the box is allow to grow
as large as is needed, though this may consume a lot of memory.
Default: \fB-1\fP, i.e. box can grow indefinite.
.TP
\fBfheat=\fP\fIfheat\fP
The ratio of diffusion angle to rms velocity dispersion in a cell.
If \fIfheat>0\fP, each time dissipation is applied, the rms
velocity dispersion in a cell is computed, and a diffusion angle
computed. The velocity vector of each particle is then
rotated with a gaussian distributed value with rms \fIfheat*velsig\fP.
This in effect gives a dissipation dependant heating source. See also
\fBsigma=\fP, which is position independant. [Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBsigma\fP=\fIangle\fP
Diffusion angle, gaussian distributed with this sigma, about which
each velocity vector is rotated after each timestep.
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBseed\fP=\fIrandom-seed\fP
Random number seed, only used when diffusion (\fBsigma=\fP) is used.
0 must be used to get the random seed from the time of the day.
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBheadline\fP=
Identifying text for this run. Default: not used.
.SH BUGS
RK, PC and PC1 don't work in rotating potential - use EULER or RK4.
.PP
Since \fBcell\fP is a fixed number throughout the execution,
is doesn't deal well with systems who's lenght-scale changes,
in particular, expanding systems will allocate more and more
space to hold the dissipation grid.
.SH DISSIPATION
Various schemes of dissipation can be invoked. Here's one, see
also Lin & Pringle (1974):
.PP
For each cell the relative position and velocity for each particle
within that cell is computed:
.nf
        R   =  r  - <r >
         i      i     i

        V   =  v  - <v >
         i      i     i
.fi
after which the dimensionless viscosity parameter 'alpha' controls
the new velocity for each particle after a timestep:
.nf
                                 < R  x  V >
                                    j     j
        u  =  <v>  - alpha  R  x ------------   +  (1-alpha) V
         i      i            i                                i
                                 < R  .  R >
                                    j     j

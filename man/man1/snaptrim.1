.TH SNAPTRIM 1NEMO "5 March 1998"
.SH NAME
snaptrim \- select a subset of the snapshot frames in a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnaptrim in=\fIin_file\fP \fBout=\fIout_file\fP [parameter=value] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnaptrim\fP reads \fIsnapshot\fP(5NEMO) data from \fBin\fP and
copies a subset of the frames to \fBout\fP.  Frames may be selected by
specifying either a time range, or sampling frequencies for particle
and diagnostic frames.
.PP
\fIsnaptrim\fP has the option of assuming the input file contains
a sorted series (in time) of snapshots, in which case the
scanning stops immediately after the last needed snapshot is
written. (see keyword \fBcheckall=\fP below).
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized:
.TP 24
\fBin=\fIin_file\fP
Input data is read from \fIin_file\fP, in \fIsnapshot\fP(5NEMO)
format.  Default: none.
.TP
\fBout=\fIout_file\fP
Selected frames are written to \fIout_file\fP.  Default: none.
.TP
\fBtimes=\fItime_range\fP
Select frames with time values within \fItime_range\fP, which is of a
form such as \fB1.0:1.5,2.5,3.0\fP. A special format is allowed to
select the Nth snapshot using \fBtimes=#\fP\fIN\fP, where
the first snapshot is counted as 1. Special values are 
\fBfirst\fP, \fBlast\fP and \fBall\fP.
Default: \fBall\fP.
.TP
\fBpartcyc=\fIinterval\fP
Select one out of every \fIinterval\fP particle frames within
\fItime_range\fP; if \fB0\fP, select none.  Default: \fB1\fP,
which selects all.
.TP
\fBdiagcyc=\fIinterval\fP
Select one out of every \fIinterval\fP diagnostic frames within
\fItime_range\fP; if \fB0\fP, select none.  Default: \fB1\fP,
which selects all.
.TP
\fBamnesia=t|f\fP
Set it to true if you don't want history records to be in the output
file. Default: \fBfalse\fP.
.TP
\fBcheckall=t|f\fP
Set it to true if you really want to be sure all snapshots are checked
if to be copied. This keyword must be set to true when the input 
snapshot is not sorted in time. By setting it to false, it can speed
up scanning enormously. Default: \fBfalse\fP.
.TP
\fBheadline=\fItext\fP
Random text which is prepended to output file only if a nonempty value
is specified.  Default: nothing.

.SH BUGS
For \fBtimes=last\fP you should not use a pipe in the input stream, i.e.
\fBin=-\fP.

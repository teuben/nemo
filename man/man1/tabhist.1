.TH TABHIST 1NEMO "14 November 2021"
.SH NAME
tabhist \- histogram plotter and gaussian fit for tabular data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBtabhist in=\fPinfile [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fItabhist\fP plots a histogram and computes the first 
4 moments of points obtained from an (set of) column(s) from an ascii 
\fItable(5NEMO)\fP.
It calculates the mean, dispersion,
skewness and kurtosis. It then plots the data in the form of a histogram,
optionally with a 'best' gaussian fit and residuals. It can also plot
a cumulative histogram of the data (see also tabtrend(1NEMO))
.PP
The median is also optionally computed, for which an 
alternate sorting routine can be selected (if available). 
.PP
If multiple columns are used, they are appended to each other and
treated like a single long column.
If you need simple statistics for multiple columns, use \fBtabstat\fP 
instead. 
.PP
Using the \fBnsigma\fP keyword, outliers can be removed
and statistics re-computed.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword is also
given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fIinfile\fP
input file, in tabular format [no default].
.TP
\fBxcol=\fIcolumn\fP
column(s) from which the (X) values are taken. 
Multiple columns can be given in the usual \fInemoinp(3NEMO)\fP notation
for integers. [default \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBxmin=\fIx_min\fP
Minimum value along X-axis to include 
[default: autoscaling on minimum of datapoints].
.TP
\fBxmax=\fIx_max\fP
Maximum value along X-axis to include 
[default: autoscaling on maximum of datapoints].
.TP
\fBbins=\fIn_bins\fP
If one number is given, it is the number of (equal size) bins between 
min and max.  If more than one number is given, they are the bin edges
(thus one more than the number of bins need to be supplied). One rule of thumb
is that the number of bins be the square root of the number of values.
[default: \fB16\fP].
.TP
\fBmaxcount=\fIcount\fP
Maximum count value per bin plotted along the Y-axis
[default: autoscaling].
.TP
\fBnmax=\fImax_lines\fP
Maximum number of lines allowed to read from datafile, if the data
comes from a pipe as supposed from file.  A regular file will
use the number of lines in the file as default.
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBylog=t|f\fP
Take log of Y-axis? This option is really redundant, since
\fItabmath(1NEMO)\fP can handle any transformation
[default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBxlab=\fIx-label\fP
Label along the X-axis [default: \fBvalue\fP].
.TP
\fBylab=\fIy-label\fP
Label along the Y-axis [default: \fBN\fP or \fBlog(N)\fP].
.TP
\fBheadline=\fItext\fP
Random verbiage, will be plotted along right top of plot for identification
[default: none].
The left top will contain the filename \fIinfile\fP.
.TP
\fBtab=t|f\fP
Table output? If false, a plot using your current \fIyapp(5NEMO)\fP
device will be given. If true, a simple ascii version of a histogram
is shown. The default choice of \fBbins=16\fP keeps all the information
on a simple 80*24 screen.
[Default: \fBf\fP]
.TP
\fBgauss=t|f\fP
If true, plot output will contain
a gaussian fit. The "best" gaussian fit is the
one that has the same mean, dispersion and integrated area
as the data. [Default: \fBt\fP].
.TP
\fBresidual=t|f\fP
If true, the residual (data - fit) will be plotted as a dashed line.
[Default: \fBt\fP].
.TP
\fBcumul=t|f\fP
Plot a cumulative histogram instead. If set, the keywords gauss, residual,
and ylog are automatically re-set to false.  
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBnorm=t|f\fP
Normalize the cumulative histogram to 1. By default the maxcount is used.
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBmedian=t|f\fP
Compute median too? This can be timeconsuming for large numbers of points.
[Default: \fBt\fP].
.TP
\fBtorben=t|f\fP
Fast median calculator in case N is large. No sort will be used, but
instead an iterative O(N) method will be used.
[Default: \fBf\fP].
\fBrobust=t|f\fP
Use a robust estimator to remove outliers before taking statistics again.
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBmad=t|f\fP 
Also compute the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBdual=t|f\fP
Dual pass over the data, subtracting the mean. This can be important
if the data have a large average value with a small spread around the mean.
Notice that in this mode the mean is subtracted but never added to
the min/max/mean/median etc. 
Default: f
.TP
\fBnsigma=\fI
Delete points more than nsigma times the sigma from the mean. After each
point sigma and mean are recomputed. [Default: none]
.TP
\fBqac=t|f\fI
If selected, a QAC listing is selected. This gives the mean, rms, min and max.
[Default: f]

.TP
\fBsort=\fP\fIsort_mode\fP
Default:  qsort.   If flogger is enabled additional sorting modes are available:
bubble, heap, insert, merge, quick, shell.
.TP
\fBpyplot=\fP
If given, it will be the filename where a template python script that can serve as starting point for more elaborate plotting.
Default: none.
.SH FLOGGER
There is a compile option to make \fBtabhist_flogger\fP which enables more sorting modes.
.SH BUGS
Points that fall exactly on the boundary of a bin, are added to the
right side. Another way of saying is that a cell includes the left side,
but is open ended on the right side, i.e. [---). Note this behavior is
exactly opposite that of SM's behavior, which was used to compare results.

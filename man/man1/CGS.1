.SH "NAME"
CGS, runCGS\-  Collisionless Galactic Simulator N-body code

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBCGS\fP 
.PP
\fBrunCGS\fP  [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fICGS\fP  (Collisionless Galactic Simulator) is a spherical harmonics Particle-Mesh code
originally presented by van Albada (1982), and recently partially rewritten and improved
by Michele Trenti.
The radial grid is adaptive, and keeps constant mass shells.
The angular dependance of the force is expressed in terms of Legendre polynomials.
The code is highly suitable to evolve quasi-spherical smooth initial condition.
.PP
The code computes the potential on an (adaptive) grid, by expanding the density
in spherical harmonics. Forces are then computed by numerical differentiation,
and particles are advanced by a global but variable time-step using a leap-frog scheme.
.PP
The code consists of an original (fortran based) executable, \fBCGS\fP, 
plus a NEMO style wrapper, named \fBrunCGS\fP. Since the 
fortran executable assumes files with a fixed name, it can be somewhat cumbersome
to run multiple sets of simulations with different input parameters.
A simple frontend organizes a directories structure and
places their output in these run directories, as well as optionally handles I/O
to/from NEMO \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP files.
.PP
A detailed code description can be found in Trenti M. (2005),  
PhD Thesis, Scuola Normale Superiore Pisa (Italy)
[mainly Chapter 3]. A copy of the thesis is in $NEMO/usr/trenti/CGS/doc/.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
There are the NEMO command line parameters for \fBrunCGS\fP:
.TP 24
\fBout=\fP\fIdirectory\fP
Output directory. Must not exist yet. 
In this directory a number of
files will be produced by the code. See below. 
No Default.
.TP
\fBnbody=\fP
Number of bodies. Only needed if a model from scratch when
for \fBflag=1\fP (see below). This parameter is limited
by the compiled NPMAX parameter in the fortran code (see below).
[Default: 40000]
.TP
\fBnrad=\fP
Number of radial zones. This number is limited by the
compiled NRGMAX parameter (see below). ??? what about angular, not as parameter ???
[Default: 80]
.TP
\fBmaxstep=\fP
Maximum number of integration steps.
[Default: 1000]
.TP
\fBdt=\fP
Initial integration step.
[Default: 0.025]
.TP
\fBtstart=\fP
Start time of integration.
[Default: 0.0]
.TP
\fBtstop=\fP
Stop time of integration.
[Default: 4.0]
.TP
\fBdtmin=\fP
Minimum allowed integration step.
[Default: 0.001]
.TP
\fBdtmax=\fP
Maximum allowed integration step.
[Default: 0.01]
.TP
\fBflag=\fP
Input Creation flag. 1=Plummer sphere from scratch (needs \fBnbody=\fP).
2=\fIclumpy homogeneous\fP from scratch (needs \fBvirial=\fP)
3=initial conditions from a POS and VEL file. 
[Default: 1]
.TP
\fBmass=\fP
Total mass of the system. 
[Default: 1.0]
.TP
\fBvirial=\fP
Initial virial ratio for \fBflag=2\fP.
[Default: 1.0]
.TP 
\fBndtcmss=\fP
Number of timesteps between CMSS (center of mass of bound particles adjustment) call.
For simulations where the coordinates of the center of mass of bound
particles are not expected to change (e.g. for simulations starting from
quasi-equilibrium configurations) consider setting \fBndtcmss\fP >= \fBmaxstep\fP.
In this case a frequent recentering of the center of expansion of the
potential might in fact introduce artificial stochastic heating. If
starting from out of equilibrium conditions, e.g. for  simulating a cold
collapse, then it is recommended to set \fBndtcmss\fP to a number sufficiently
small that several recenterings are performed in a dynamical time.
[Default: 2000]
.TP
\fBndtdiag=\fP
Number of timesteps between diagnostics call. Note that each diagnostics call 
has some overhead associated with it.
[Default: 50]
.TP
\fBndtout=\fP
Number of time steps between writing snapshots.
Note that each call has some overhead associated with it if the potential is selected for output
[Default: 10]
.TP
\fBin=\fP\fIfile\fP
Input data is read from \fIfile\fP, which must be a structured binary file.
If left blank, it is assumed that the (plummer) flag parameter is set to
1 or 2. Note that masses are ignored. Files must be given in an absolute
directory notation, no relative patchs.
.TP
\fBexe=\fP\fIexecutable\fP
Name of the (fortran) executable. Needs to be in your search $PATH, or else
the full absolute path needs to be supplied here.
[Default: CGS.exe]
.TP
\fBnemo=t|f\fP
Should the snapshot data be converted to NEMO format? If so, the ASCII snapshot
is removed. NOTE: Using this option requires extra diskspace. Default: [\fBt\fP]

.SH "COMPILATION"
Note that various parameters (maximum grid size, maximum number of particles)
are hardcoded during compilation, though easily changed in the right file:
.nf
.ta +1i +2i
common.blk:	parameter(NPMAX=2000000)	Max number of particles
common.blk:	parameter(NRGMAX=501)		Max number of radial grids

.fi

.SH "BENCHMARKS"
The standard benchmark is 40000 particles and runs for 832 steps. The user CPU is listed (in sec)
in the 2nd column.

You can run the command either as:
.nf
   % make bench2
   which is
   % /usr/bin/time runCGS out=bench1 nemo=f
or
   % /usr/bin/time CGS
.fi
Adding \fBnemo=t\fP (the default) would add about 15%.

.SH "DATA CONVERSION"
If output \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP are requested, CGS will create a file \fBfort.90\fP,
which can be converted to NEMO's \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP, viz.
.nf
   tabtos $old/fort.90 snap90 nbody,time skip,pos,vel,acc,phi
.fi

.SH "UNITS"
Although all particles are equally massive (by the nature of the code),
the total mass of the system can be choosen as an input parameter. The
gravitation constant is 4.4971, which is appropriate for a galactic
scale system where the units (see also \fIunits(5NEMO)\fP) are
10^11 solar mass, 10 kpc and 10^8 years. This gives a unit of velocity
of about 97.8 km/s.

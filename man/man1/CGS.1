.SH NAME
CGS, runCGS\-  Collisionless Galactic Simulator N-body code
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBCGS\fP 
.PP
\fBrunCGS\fP  [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fICGS\fP  (Collisionless Galactic Simulator) is a spherical harmonics Particle-Mesh code
originally presented by van Albada (1982), and recently partially rewritten and improved by
by Michele Trenti.
The radial grid is adaptive, and keeps constant mass shells.
The angular dependance of the force is expressed in terms of Legendre polynomials.
The code is highly suitable to evolve quasi-spherical smooth initial condition.
.PP
The code computes the potential on an (adaptive) grid, by expanding the density
in spherical harmonics. Forces are then computed by numerical differentiation,
and particles are advanced by a global but variable time-step using a leap-frog scheme.
.PP
The code consists of an original (fortran based) executable, \fBCGS\fP, 
plus a NEMO style wrapper, named \fBrunCGS\fP. Since the 
fortran executable assumes files with a fixed name, it is somewhat cumbersome
to run multiple sets of simulations with different input.
A simple frontend organizes a directories structure and
places their output in these run directories.

.SH PARAMETER
There are the NEMO command line parameters for \fBrunCGS\fP:
.TP 24
\fBout=\fP\fIdirectory\fP
Output directory. Must not exist yet. 
In this directory a number of
files will be produced by the code. See below. 
No Default.
.TP
\fBnbody=\fP
Number of bodies. Only needed if a model from scratch when
for \fBflag=1\fP (see below). This parameter is limited
by the compiled NPMAX parameter in the fortran code (see below).
[Default: 40000]
.TP
\fBnrad=\fP
Number of radial zones. This number is limited by the
compiled NRGMAX parameter (see below). ??? what about angular, not as parameter ???
[Default: 80]
.TP
\fBmaxstep=\fP
Maximum number of integration steps.
[Default: 1000]
.TP
\fBdt=\fP
Initial integration step.
[Default: 0.025]
.TP
\fBtstart=\fP
Start time of integration.
[Default: 0.0]
.TP
\fBtstop=\fP
Stop time of integration.
[Default: 4.0]
.TP
\fBdtmin=\fP
Minimum allowed integration step.
[Default: 0.001]
.TP
\fBdtmax=\fP
Maximum allowed integration step.
[Default: 0.01]
.TP
\fBflag=\fP
Input Plummer flag. 1=plummer sphere from scratch (needs \fBnbody=\fP).
2=\fIclumpy homogeneous\fP from scratch (needs \fBvirial=\fP)
3=initial conditions from a POS and VEL file. 
[Default: 1]
.TP
\fBmass=\fP
Total mass of the system. **todo : wrapper should check and computer if in= used **
[Default: 1.0]
.TP
\fBvirial=\fP
Initial virial ratio for \fBflag=2\fP.
[Default: 1.0]
.TP 
\fBndtcmss=\fP
Number of timesteps between CMSS (center of mass adjustment) call.
[Default: 2000]
.TP
\fBndtdiag=\fP
Number of timesteps between diagnostics call. Note that each diagnostics call 
has some overhead associated with it.
[Default: 50]
.TP
\fBndtout=\fP
Number of time steps between writing snapshots.
Note that each call has some overhead associated with it if the potential is selected for output
[Default: 10]
.TP
\fBin=\fP\fIfile\fP
Input data is read from \fIfile\fP, which must be a structured binary file.
If left blank, it is assumed that the (plummer) flag parameter is set to
1 or 2. Note that masses are ignored. Files must be given in an absolute
directory notation, no relative patchs.
.TP
\fBexe=\fP\fIexecutable\fP
Name of the (fortran) executable. Needs to be in your search $PATH, or else
the full absolute path needs to be supplied here.
[Default: CGS.exe]
.TP
\fBnemo=t|f\fP
Should the snapshot data be converted to NEMO format? If so, the ASCII snapshot
is removed. NOTE: Using this option requires extra diskspace. Default: [\fBt\fP]

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example uses runCGS to run the standard benchmark:
.nf
   % runCGS out=bench1 
.fi
.SH COMPILATION
Note that various parameters (maximum grid size, maximum number of particles)
are hardcoded during compilation, though easily changed in the right file:
.nf
.ta +1i +2i
common.blk:	parameter(NPMAX=2000000)	Max number of particles
common.blk:	parameter(NRGMAX=501)		Max number of radial grids

common.blk:	parameter(LMAX=7)        	Legendre Polynomials (do not modify)
common.blk:	parameter(NCE=28)        	Max number of Spherical Harmonics Coefficients (do not modify)

.fi
.SH BENCHMARKS

You can run the command either as:
.nf
   % time runCGS out=bench1 nemo=f
or
   % time CGS
.fi
.SH DATA CONVERSION
If snapshots are requested, CGS will create a file \fBfort.90\fP, which can be converted
to NEMO's \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP
.nf

.fi

.SH UNITS
Although all particles are equally massive (by the nature of the code),
the total mass of the system can be choosen as an input parameter. The
gravitation constant is 4.4971, which is appropriate for a galactic
scale system where the units (see also \fIunits(5NEMO)\fP) are
10^11 solar mass, 10 kpc and 10^8 years. This gives a unit of velocity
of about 97.8 km/s

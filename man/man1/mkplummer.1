.TH MKPLUMMER 1NEMO "27 May 2024"

.SH "NAME"
mkplummer \- construct a Plummer model

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmkplummer\fP [parameters=values...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fImkplummer\fP constructs an N-body realization of a Plummer model,
with a spatial or mass based
cut-off, after which it (optionally) performs a coordinate transformation to the
center-of-mass coordinate system. The data are then written into a
file \fIsnap-file\fP, in a standard N-body \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP format.  
The model
is constructed in VIRIAL or NBODY units (M=G=-4E=1, with E the total energy),
and finite spatial extent which can be regulated by specifying
\fImfrac\fP or \fIrfrac\fP or using their default values.  The
distribution function of a Plummer model is spherically symmetric and
isotropic, and is a polytrope of index n = 5. 
See also Aarseth et al. (1974) and Plummer (1911).
.PP
There is also an implementation in Dehnen's falcON suite: \fImkplum(1falcON)\fP

For more advanced Plummer models, see \fImcluster(1NEMO)\fP.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.so man1/parameters
.TP 25
\fBout=\fP\fIsnapfile\fP
Output data is written into \fIsnapfile\fP, in standard \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP format.
.br
No default
.TP
\fBnbody=\fP\fIinteger\fP
Number of particles in the model.
.br
No default.
.TP
\fBmlow=\fP\fIreal\fP
inner core mass fraction within which no stars will be populated.
.br
[Default: 0]
.TP
\fBmfrac=\fP\fIreal\fP
mass fraction of the (otherwise infinitely extended) Plummer model;
see  rfrac immediately below 
Note that the total mass is still normalized to 1.
.br
[Default: \fIrfrac\fP=22.8042468]
.TP
\fBrfrac=\fP\fIreal\fP
radius fraction of the (otherwise infinitely extended) Plummer model. If
\fImfrac = 1.0\fP then particles will be sprinkled in all over
space. If \fImfrac\fP < 1.0 or \fIrfrac\fP > 0.0 then each particle is
constrained to lie within both the radial and (cumulative) mass bound.
For example, if \fIrfrac\fP( \fImfrac\fP ) > \fIrfrac\fP then
\fIrfrac\fP is the limiting factor, but if \fIrfrac\fP( \fImfrac\fP )
< \fIrfrac\fP then \fImfrac\fP limits the extent of the Plummer
realization.  Note: specifying either value may have no effect if the
default value of the other parameter is still the limiting factor;
Beware! (Default: \fImfrac\fP=0.999; \fIrfrac\fP=22.8042468 , chosen
so that the cumulative mass at \fIrfrac\fP is \fImfrac\fP).
.br
Default: ....
.TP
\fBseed=\fP\fIinteger\fP
seed for the random number generator. A value of 0 (the default)
will be converted into a unique new value using UNIX's clock time, in
seconds since 1970.0). See also \fIxrandom(1NEMO)\fP for more options.
.br
[Default: 0]
.TP
\fBtime=\fP\fItime\fP
Time at which the snapshot applies
.br
[Default: 0.0]
.TP
\fBzerocm=t|f\fP
Reset center of mass to zero?
.br
[Default: \fBt\fP].
.TP
\fBscale=\fP\fIscale_factor\fP
A scale factor or scale to virial units (M=G=-4E=1). Use -1 for
virial units (see also UNITS below),
and 1 to get a model in structural (natural) units.
Note: large scale factors means small systems with large velocity
disperson.
.br
[Default: \fB-1\fP].
.TP
\fBquiet=\fIlevel\fP
Level of quit start. 0 is noisy, 1=somewhat quiet, 2=more quiet. See "QUIET START" below
.br
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBmassname=\fIname\fP
Identification of the mass spectrum. It is normally only a function
of mass, so \fBn(m)\fP will suffice. If nothing specified, all
stars will have the same mass (total mass M=1).
.br
[Default: not used].
.TP
\fBmassexpr=\fIexpr\fP
Expression for the mass-spectrum. In addition to the mass \fIm\fP from
the \fBmassname\fP it may contain any variables contained in the 
\fBmasspars\fP to be specified next.
.br
[Default: \fBpow(m,p)\fP].
.TP
\fBmasspars=\fIpars\fP
List of parameters and their values. They can be used by name in the
\fBmassexpr\fP specified before.
.br
[Default: \fBp,0.0\fP].
.TP
\fBmassrange=\fImlow,mhigh\fP
Valid massrange. A lower and higher cutoff must be supplied. The massrange
has arbitrary units, since all masses will be rescaled to set the total
mass M=1.
.br
[Default: \fB1,1\fP].
.TP
\fBheadline=\fP\fIstring\fP
Optional headline, which is written as the first item in the snapshot
file, the next item being the snapshot itself.
.br
[Default: not used].
.TP
\fBnmodel=\fP\fIinteger\fP
Number of models to generate. All models will be different here.
Although mostly meant for benchmarks,
generating more then 1 model can be useful to process very large
snapshots (that normally won't fit in memory) in a serialized fashion. See
also \fIsnapsplit\fP. Most NEMO programs will only read the first
snapshot. See also \fBmkgrid nmodel=\fP for a faster way to benchmark.
.br
[Default: \fB1\fP]
.TP
\fBmode=0|1|2\fP
The processing mode, purely for debugging benchmarks.
0=no data written.
1=data written, but no extra analysis.
2=data written, and extra analysis done.
.br
[Default: 1]

.SH "UNITS"
The scale length of a Plummer sphere in virial units is \fB3.pi/16\fP
~ 0.589.  As an example the following two commands
should plot the same "rotation" curve:
.EX

 mkplummer - 10000 | radprof - tab=t | tabplot - 1 3 0 2 0 1 yapp=1/xs
 rotcurves plummer '0,1,3*pi/16' xrange=0,2 yrange=0,1       yapp=2/xs 

.EE

.SH "QUIET START"
For small N-body systems it can easily happen that small random fluctuations
cause a unacceptabel large deviation from an ideal Plummer sphere. One way to
achieve more "quiet" initial conditions is by positioning the particles more "uniformly" in
their 1/N mass shells, instead of uniformly filling the space between 0 and 1. This is
controlled by the \fBquiet=1\fP setting.   An even more quiet start can be achieved
by placing the particles on exactly the radius compatible with its mass fraction, this is
achieved with the the \fBquiet=2\fP setting.
.PP
In this example you can clearly see the difference between the radii selected:
.EX

 mkplummer - 10 quiet=0 zerocm=f | snapsort - - r | snapprint - r | tabplot - 0 1 line=1,1 point=2,0.1
 mkplummer - 10 quiet=1 zerocm=f | snapsort - - r | snapprint - r | tabplot - 0 1 line=1,1 point=2,0.1
 mkplummer - 10 quiet=2 zerocm=f | snapsort - - r | snapprint - r | tabplot - 0 1 line=1,1 point=2,0.1

.EE
Important to note that with \fBzerocm=f\fP the center of mass will drift, while the "mathematical center"
was placed at the origin. This will counter the quietness, if you will.

.SH "CAVEATS"
A non-delta function mass-spectrum will not create a properly
virialized system yet. See \fIsnapvirial(1NEMO)\fP
.PP
For very large (>1000) ratio in the mass ranges the spline
interpolation, used in \fIfrandom(3NEMO)\fP, can fail
using a valid [0,1] range.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
mkplummer can also be used to create a plummer sphere with a mass spectrum, e.g.
a Salpeter mass spectrum with
.EX

 mkplummer salpeter.dat 10000 massname='n(m)' massexpr='pow(m,p)' masspars=p,-2.35 massrange=0.1,10

.EE
Another method to create a Plummer sphere is by using the Osipkov-Merritt tables in NEMO, e.g.
.EX

 plummer plum.dat ntab=1024
 mkommod plum.dat plum.snap nbody=10000

.EE
or in ZENO their new General Spherical Profile:
.EX

 plumsnap plum1.snap

 plumgsp plum.gsp
 gsprealize plum.gsp plum.snap zerocm=true
 snapcopy plum.snap plum2.snap

.EE
with a note that ZENO files may need an extra \fIsnapcopy(1NEMO)\fP to be compatible with NEMO
\fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP files.

.SH "BENCHMARKS"
The default benchmark (see Benchfile) creates a 10,000,000 snapshot in double precision,
with and without writing to a local file:
.EX

 cd $NEMO/nemo/src/nbody/init/
 make -f Benchfile bench0 bench1

    or
    
 /usr/bin/time mkplummer . 10000000
 /usr/bin/time mkplummer bench1.snap 10000000

.EE
with some sample CPU for bench0:
.EX
   xps13       3.1s  or 171 MB/s
   t480        4.9s  or  72 MB/s
.EE
the time difference betweeen bench0 and bench1 can be interpreted as
the time needed to write 535MB (for 10M particles)

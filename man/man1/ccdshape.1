.TH CCDSHAPE 1NEMO "12 June 2013"

.SH "NAME"
ccdshape \- shape of a 2D or 3D distribution based on moments of inertia

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBccdshape\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Based on intensity weighted moments of inertia, the center, primary axes
and their angles (position angle, inclination, or euler) are computed.
.PP
By default, the three axes in a cube are treated in the same way, but for
astronomical
spectral line cubes the first two (RA-DEC) are different from the third (VEL).
In this case the third axis is decoupled, and instead of sizes and euler angles,
the largest velocity gradient dV/dR and a position angle between kinematic and 
morphological major axis is used.

.SH "PARAMETERS"

.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file [???]    
.TP
\fBclip=\fP
Use only values above clip, and below -clip, if only one value given. If two
values given, exclude this range of values. Setting clip=0 should be sufficient
to discard all pixels with the value 0.0.
Default: all values used.
.TP
\fBwcs=t|f\fP
Use axis world coordinate system descriptors or the 0-based coordinate axis
numbers. Default: true.
.TP
\fBradecvel=t|f\fP
Treat the 3rd axis like a separate velocity axis. This decouples the geometry
from the velocity axis. Default: false.
.TP
\fBweight=t|f\fP
Use intensity weighted moments? The alternative is all pixels equal weight.
Default: true.
.TP
\fBcross=t|f\fP
Should cross correlations be taken into account? Normally want this, since that
is what gives the position angles, but some codes (e.g. miriad::clstats) do
not do this, so for comparison this option is available. [Default: true]
.SH CAVEATS
Derived sizes are not corrected for any beam shapes and sizes that may be
present in the header of an image.

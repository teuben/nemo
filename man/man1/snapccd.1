.TH SNAPCCD 1NEMO "30 January 1989"

.SH "NAME"
snapccd \- top view integrated velocity moment ccd-like image

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBsnapccd in=\fPsnapshot \fBout=\fPimage [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsnapccd\fP makes a ccd frame from an N-body snapshot, by
binning the (projected) x-y coordinates of all stars on a regular 
rectangular (square) grid and
assigning a mean integrated 'surface density' (integrated along z-axis, i.e. 
the line of sight,
The ccd frame is written to a standard \fIImage(5NEMO)\fP output file, and can
be accessed by various other programs for smoothing, display etc.
.PP
Stellar astronomers refer to this type of 2-d histogram
as a "Hess diagram" when it is used to plot a color-magnitude
diagram of stars. 
.PP
\fBsnapccd\fP can also create channel maps, where only signal near a
specified velocity is copied. See the \fBvrange\fP and \fBmoment\fP
keywords below. One can use either an exact velocity window, or
a gaussian beam in velocity space.
.PP
Note that the radial velocity has the astronomical convention. The observer
is located at infinity at the positive Z-axis: a positive z velocity
(\fBvz\fP) means stars are approaching, i.e. negative radial velocity.
.PP
\fIsnaprotate(1NEMO)\fP has to be used first to do any other than a top-view,
probably the more general version \fIsnapgrid(1NEMO)\fP should be used.
.PP
A better alternative is \fIsnapgrid(1NEMO)\fP, and for
more interpolation (as opposed to gridding) style is
\fIsnapmap(1NEMO)\fP


.SH "PARAMETERS"
.so/man1 parameters
.TP 20
\fBin=\fIin-file\fP
input file, must be in \fISnapShot(5NEMO)\fP format [no default].
.TP
\fBout=\fIout-file\fP
output file, will be in \fIImage(5NEMO)\fP format [no default].
.TP
\fBorigin=\fIx,y\fP
The origin \fI(x,y)\fP of the center of the ccd [default: \fB0,0\fP].
.TP
\fBsize=\fIvalue\fP
Full size of the CCD frame in 'physical' units. Note that the picture 
is forced to be square [default: \fB4.0\fP].
.TP
\fBcell=\fIvalue\fP
Cell- or pixel size. Again they will be square. For a 2D matrix
this value will be set by the header of that dataset.
[default: \fB0.1\fP].
.TP
\fBvrange=\fIvmin:vmax | vmean,vsig\fP
Range in (astronomical) radial velocity (\fB-vz\fP) to be used
only while binning the data. One can also give a mean and dispersion
in velocity space to weigh the data with. In this case the range in
velocity space is somewhat arbitrarely taken from
\fIvmean-3*vsig:vmean+3*vsig\fP. This last procedure is somewhat more
realistic for astronomical applications, unless the package where the
data will be transported to has decent smoothing utilities in velocity
space also. 
The default of this keyword is to take all data along the vz axis.
It does not make sense to select data along the z-axis when the
\fBmoment\fP (see below) is non-zero. [default: \fB-infinity:infinity\fP].
.TP
\fBmoment=\fInumber\fP
Order of the velocity moment: must be a non-negative number.
Most commonly choosen are: \fB0\fP (total intensity), \fB1\fP 
(velocity weighted intensity) and \fB2\fP (velocity square weighted intensity),
where 'intensity' should really be read as surface density per square unit length.
[default: \fB0\fP].

.SH "EXAMPLE"
The following example makes (three) CCD frames from an N-body snapshot,
smoothes the three moment maps
and combines them into an 'intensity' (\fBint\fP), 'mean velocity' (\fBvel\fP)
and 'velocity dispersion' (\fBsig\fP) map. 
.PP
Note that the moment maps must be smoothed \fIbefore\fP they
can be combined to the proper velocity and dispersion maps.

.SH "UNITS"
Units are maintained in the same way as in snapshots, they don't have
a specific name, but carry their normal meaning 'length', 'velocity'
and 'mass'. Since \fIsnapccd\fP calculates surface densities,
its units are formally 'mass' per square 'length' times 'velocity'
to the power \fBmoment\fP. 
.PP
When channel maps are produced (\fBmoment=0\fP), 
the data are not normalized w.r.t. the
convolving velocity beam. For a rectangular beam (\fBvrange=vmin:vmax\fP)
the data should formally be divided by \fB(vmax-vmin)\fP, for a 
gaussian beam (\fBvrange=vmean,vsig\fP) by \fBvsig*sqrt(2*pi)\fP.
Also remember that a gaussian beam has \fBFWHM = 2.355*sigma\fP.

.SH "FUTURE"
\fIsnapccd(1NEMO)\fP's function is rather similar to that of
\fIsnapplot(1NEMO)\fP,
except of plotting the position of the stars, its bins the data.
It would be a nice idea to combine both programs.

.SH "CAVEATS"
If smoothing is followed after gridding, the resulting beam is actually
slightly larger than the smoothing beam.

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
The program gracefully allows the user to use nonzero \fBmoment\fP
and a non-infinite \fBvrange\fP. No warnings here.

.TH U3TOS 1NEMO "19 February 2019"
.SH NAME
u3tos \- Convert NBODY unit 3 output data to snapshot
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBu3tos\fP \fBin=\fP\fIOUT3\fP \fBout=\fP\fIsnapshot_file\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIu3tos\fP converts the output of one of the Aarseth
NBODY integrators (see e.g. \fInbody1(1NEMO)\fP) to a 
snapshot file for further manipulation wihtin NEMO.
.PP
The binary output file (normally called \fBOUT3\fP) normally
has to be converted on the host machine where the simulations
have been run, although some support exists for cross-platform
usage, in particular when only endianism is the issue.
.PP
It is strongly recommended to 
use \fIunfio(1NEMO)\fP and check if a dataset looks ok. You may also 
need to set \fBswap=t\fP in this program, as well as
a \fBmode=\fP and \fBheader=\fP choice.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input file (in NBODY's OUT3 binary format). Is known to work with OUT3
files from NBODY1, NBODY2 and NBODY5. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output file (snapshot(5NEMO) format). No default.
.TP
\fBframe=\fP
Frames to read (0=all). Currently only 1 frame, or all, can be selected
for output. Default: 0.
.TP
\fBalen=\fP
Use this if you need to override the length of the \fBA\fP array
that is present in the data dumps. Normally the header I/O routine
will figure this out for you. There are some older format
dumps that do not contain this variable. Use 0 to process old
datafiles that do not have an A array.
By default this variable is not set (autodetection via header).
.TP
\fBswap=t|f\fP
Should bytes be swapped upon reading? This allows
reading data that were created on a machine that had the
opposite endianism from the one you're using this program one.
By default no byte swapping is performed.
.TP
\fBmode=1|2|4|6\fP
Which of the nbodyX style of output to support. Allowed are 1 and 2 (identical
actually), 4 (which also outputs rho and phi,and an addition key for each
particle), and 6. Default: 1
.TP
\fBheader=|4|8\fP
Header size of the fortran unformatted data. This is 4 (old fortran) or 8 (modern
compilers, such as gfortran). 
By default the value determined to be the correct value for your compiler is used.
.TP
\fBinteger=2|4\fP
Signal the reader what kind of INTEGERs were used in the output dataset.
Older data may have used INTEGER*2, which limits the number of particles
to 32767, patched programs (and presumably later official versions from Sverre)
will always write INTEGER*4 (or having the same size as a REAL),
[Default: \fB4\fP].
.SH CAVEATS
At the current time the \fBmode=\fP and \fBheader=\fP must be known in order
for the conversion to succeed. There is no runtime autodetection of formats yet.

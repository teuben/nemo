.TH SDINFO 1NEMO "27 September 2021"
.SH NAME
sdinfo \- sdfits (BINTABLE) info and benchmark
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsdinfo\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsdinfo\fP list some tabular properties of an SDFITS (and some dialects) file, and has 
options to benchmark some basic operations.
.PP
SDFITS files have a BINTABLE extension named "SINGLE DISH", and is used to store
single dish spectra and all associated variables. This program was only
written to provide size info and can run a few basic benchmarks. A few known dialects
to this are known:  "CIMAFITS" (Arecibo) and "MATRIX" (30m/CLASS), the latter designates
the spectrum via a "SPECTRUM" column name, instead of the more common "DATA" column name.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input SDFITS fits file. Multiple files can be given as well, as a space or comma separated this.
No default.
.TP
\fBstats=t|f\fP
If true, some basic statistics will be computed. You also need this option
if a row (see row= below) is output.
.TP
\fBmom=\fP\fI
Maximum moment some statistics will be computed. mom=0 will just sum, and be much faster than
general moment computation. [2].
.TP
\fBcols=\fP
Column names to track. Currently it just gives the column number and format used.  Default: not used.
.TP
\fBdims=\fP
A list of dimensions how the data-block should be processed. The procedure of processing is
set by the \fBproc=\fP keyword.  For example dims=2,11,2,2,4.   The product
of the dimensions should be NAXIS2 (or less than) from the BINTABLE. Default: not used.
.TP
\fBproc=\fP
The procedure of processing can be set with this. Currently only one specific example
(see EXAMPLES below) for ngc5291 is implemented. Options would be PS (Position Switching),
FS (frequency switching), NOD (nodding), TP (total power). NOT IMPLEMENTED YET, if ever.
.TP
\fBnchan=\fP
Override the number of channels found in the data. Some dataset will find nchan=0 and it will
be useful to set this here. This number is related to NAXIS1 in the BINTABLE.
.TP
\fBrow=\fP
If used, this row (0 being the first) will be output as an ascii spectrum. This spectrum has two
columns: channel number (0 being the first) and the spectrum value, native units.
.TP
\fBbench=\fP
How many times the procedure should be processed. This will only re-execute the procedure,
not the alloc/free that are needed for this. Using 0 will bypass the procedure. Default: 1
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example takes all fits files matching a particular pattern and summarize their contents.
.nf
    ls *.?.fits > dirin.lis

Here is a benchmark of the GBT ngc5291 example:
.nf
    time sdinfo ngc5291.fits dims=2,11,2,2,4 bench=100 help=c
    ### nemo Debug Info: ngc5291.fits : Nrows: 352   Ncols: 46  Nchan: 32768
    ### nemo Debug Info: DATA keyword TDIM7 = (32768,1,1,1)

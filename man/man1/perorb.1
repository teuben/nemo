.TH PERORB 1NEMO "29 October 2019"
.SH NAME
perorb \- find periodic orbits in symmetric potentials
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBperorb \fBout=\fPorbit [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIperorb\fP searches for periodic orbits in two ways:
.PP
In the iterative mode it will integrate an orbit for a half or
whole period, and iteratively converge towards a periodic orbit
assuming regular phase space where the surface of section
is a single point. It uses a convergence criterion
in the surface of section coordinates.
It then can proceed, and attempt to find family members
with slightly different energies or spatial extent.
The orbits can be stored in a binary file along the way, and also a table
with major an minor axis rotation curves, period, energy and average
angular momentum can be stored in a table.
.PP
In the interactive mode (ncross>1) the selected orbits are integrated for a
specified number of surface of section (S.O.S.)
crossings, and their S.O.S. 
coordinates are plotted; from a visual inspection the central 
periodic orbit(s) can then be estimated at this energy, and
used to get good estimates in the iterative mode to find
the periodic orbits.
.PP
This technique has been used in various forms by various researchers, 
and is described in its most original form in 
Henon (1965, Ann.Astr. 28, 499). See also
El-Sabaa & Sherief (1990) Ap&SS 167, 305 for some more recent work.
.PP
Alternatives approaches are the Particle Swarm Optimization
(Skokos et al. 2005). There is also code by T.S.v Albada, but
not yet released in NEMO.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword is also
given:
.TP
\fBin=\fIin-file\fP
An optional input file in standard \fIorbit(5NEMO)\fP format.
If given, the input conditions are taken from the first
phase point in this orbit (using the keyword \fBlast=\fP 
you can select the last orbit). Default: none.
\fBout=\fIout-file\fP
output file, into which the orbits are accumulated.
The file is in standard \fIorbit(5NEMO)\fP format.
If no filename is given, the iterative mode is followed.
[Default: none].
.TP
\fBfreqout=\fIrate\fP
Frequency for output of the timeslots for the periodic
orbits. 
\fIOnly used in iterative mode.\fP
[default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBmaxsteps=\fInumber\fP
maximum number of reserved integration steps. [default: \fB5000\fP].
.TP
\fBdt=\fItime-step\fP
time step (constant) to be taken [default: \fB0.05\fP].
.TP
\fBphase=\fItrial-phase\fP
Initial trial phase space coodinates for orbit. The full
6 phase-space coordinates can specified, although
you can also specify the (x0,v0) for dirint=0 or (y0,u0) for
dirint=1.
If a 7th (or 3rd) number is given (optional), 
this is taken as the trial energy for the
first orbit. The trial launch velocity is then calculated from the
available potential at the specified launch position.
.TP
\fBstep=\fIstep,perturb\fP
Step in phase space to take to get next orbit (the step
is taken in the direction given by the
\fBdir\fP keyword. The second number is the perturbation in
direction \fBdir\fP used to start the first iteration
that should result in finding the periodic orbit.
Default: 0.1,0.01
.TP
\fBdir=x|y\fP
Direction in which to step for next orbit.
This also determines in which
surface of section the searching for the periodic orbit
is done. Only \fBx\fP and \fBy\fP are allowed for now, since only
planar XY-orbits are handled properly.
.TP
\fBnorbit=\fIn\fP
Number of orbits to investigate. [Default: 1]
.TP
\fBaccuracy=\fIeps\fP
A relative accuracy parameter to which the final
surface of section coordinate is to be accurate. 
\fIOnly used in iterative mode.\fP
[Default: 0.001].
.TP
\fBmaxiter=\fP
Maximum iterations allowed to find a periodic orbit.
Default: 50.
.TP
\fBncross=\fIcount\fP
Number of crossings through surface of section
used to plot/iterate. This count does include the 
half-period crossings if the keyword \fBperiod=2\fP
is choosen. If set larger than 1, interactive mode is used.
[default: \fB1\fP]
.TP
\fBperiod=2|1\fP
The number of surface of section coordinates to generate
per period. Must be either 1 or 2. A value of 2 make
search faster, but a bit more difficult for irregular orbits
or near resonances. Also non-symmetric orbits cannot be found
this way. [default: \fB2\fP].
.TP
\fBpotname=\fIname\fP
name of file of \fIpotential(5NEMO)\fP descriptor 
[default: \fBplummer\fP].
.TP
\fPpotpars=\fIpar-list\fP
List of parameters to the potential descriptor. The first
parameter must be the pattern speed in the x-y plane,
although rotating frames of reference are not
yet supported. The remaining parameters are used by the
\fI_inipotential()\fP routine in the potential descriptor.
[default: none - let them be defined by routine itself].
.TP
\fBpotfile=\fIname\fP
name of an optional datafile to the potential descriptor.
This might be an N-body snapshot or list of spline fit
coefficients etc. [default: none].
.TP
\fBtab=\fItable_file\fP
If set to a filename, a table, which normally appears on
\fIstdout\fP is now written to a file. It contains the
two axes rotation curves, number of steps in the orbit,
numer of iterations in surface of section, the full period and 
the energy: \fIpos,vel,pos,vel,nsteps,niter,period,energy\fP.
[Default: none].
.TP
\fBmode=\fIint_mode\fP
Specify the integration mode. Any one of \fBeuler\fP,
\fBleapfrog\fP, \fBrk2\fP or \fBrk4\fP 
can be given.
[Default: \fBrk4\fP].
.TP
\fBlast=t|f\fP
Controls which orbit from the input file is used for the
initial conditions. By default, the first one, otherwise
the last. Default: \fBf\fP.
.TP
\fBheadline=\fP
Random user verbiage added to the output file. Default:none
.SH CAVEATS
The potential (potname= etc) needs to have a proper potential defined
for this routine to work.
.SH EXAMPLES
By default, perorb will find a circular orbit in a plummer potential
near R=1:

The last command  shows the ratio of the angular momentum along the major
and minor axis, and that they equal the axis ratio (q) of the potential.

In interactive mode the Time,Ycross,VYcross,Energy for each surface
of section are listed, and can be piped
into tabplot to get an idea of phase space and help you getter better initial
conditions.

In the 1st example we establish that energy is roughly conserved (and the value is 0.0322215). The
2nd example plots the SOS. The 3rd example takes column 2 and 3 and fits an ellipse and reports
the center. The 4th example tries to reproduce the periodic orbit with that specified energy.

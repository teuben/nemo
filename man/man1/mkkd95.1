.SH "NAME"
mkkd95 \- Kuijken-Dubinski-95 composite disk-bulge-halo model
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmkkd95\fP [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBmkkd95\fP creates a composite Disk-Bulge-Halo galaxy in 
near equilibrium following the procedure described in
Kuijken & Dubinksi (1995). This program is merely a NEMO wrapper
that assembles all the correct parameters, runs the a set
of KD95 programs (commonly referred to as
the GalactICS Software) in a temporary rundirectory and converts the
ascii output to a NEMO \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP. 
.PP
The bulge and halo are  a King and lowered Evans distribution
resp, whereas the disk a 3D generalization of Shu's planar disk
to include a 3rd integral of motion to account for the vertical
structure. The construction occurs in 3 steps. First the potential
is calculated, after which the disk distribution function
is constructed which generates the given potential. Finally,
each component is realized with a self-consistent distribution
of particle orbits.
.PP
Although one
has the option of including any combination of components,
leaving out the halo probably won't work.
.PP
Two new versions have been published since the current 1995 K&D version:
Widrow & Dubinski (2005) and Widrow, Pym and Dubinski (2008). These are
not (yet) supported in the current \fBmkkd95\fP program.
.PP
The GalactICS package is also available within \fIamuse(1NEMO)\fP.

.SH "PROCEDURE"
Creating a galaxy model from these parameters is sort of a black art
since the halo and bulge models are not parameterized in terms of
their mass profiles but rather properties of their distribution
functions.  Changes in psi0, v0 etc. have weird but predictable
effects on the mass profile.
.PP
The halo is a flattened analogue of the King model so the concentration
(R_tidal/R_core) is determined by the dimensionless central potential
psi_0/sigma_0^2.  The more negative the value the greater the
concentration.  The parameters R_a and v_0, affect the scaling of the
halo mass profile.
.PP
The effect of different bulge parameters is more predictable.  Decreasing the
central velocity dispersion will create a more centrally concentrated
bulge and decreasing the psi cut off will truncate the bulge and decrease
its total mass.
.PP
The disk is parameterized directly by its mass profile so its effect on the
rotation curve is predictable ahead of time.
.PP
Hit and miss seems to be a good strategy for finding a suitable profile.
Generate a model to lmax=2 and then view the resulting rotation curve by 
using the \fIvcirc\fP program, in  which 
the contributions to the total rotation curve are tabulated.  Another useful
file is \fImr.dat\fP which tells you the mass and radial extent of the disk
bulge and halo.
.PP
The program \fIplotforce\fP will also generate the rotation curves for you
directly from the dbh.dat, b.dat and h.dat files.
.PP
The potential is determined iteratively: starting from an initial
guess at the potential, the density implied by the halo and bulge DFs
is calculated, the disk density added, and the potential of that mass
distribution is used as starting point for the next
iteration. Initially only the monopole (l=0) components are calculated
until the model converges, then one more harmonic is added per
iteration up to the maximum requested, and once all harmonics are
included the iterations are continued until the outer (tidal) radius
of the halo is unchanged between iterations. At each iterations plots
of the harmonic expansion coefficients are produced.
If the tidal radius reported is "outside grid" for a large number of
iterations, increase the number of radial bins or increase their
size. Sometimes infinite tidal radii are also reported: this happens
when the total mass of the model using the current guess for the
potential is insufficient to generate a potential well as deep as
requested. If this persists over many iterations, again increase the
number or size of the radial bins.
.PP

.SH "PROGRAMS"
Although \fBmkkd95\fP calls a number of KD95 programs, here is a brief
explanation of some of them:
.PP
\fBdbh\fP calculates the potential. From in.dbh is computes
dbh.dat, h.dat, b.dat and mr.dat.
.PP
\fBgetfreqs\fP tabulates various characteristic frequencies (omega, kappa etc.)
in the equatorial plane for use by \fBdiskdf\fP. Input files are 
dbh.dat h.dat b.dat, and it generates freqdbh.dat
.PP
\fBdiskdf\fP iteratively calculates the correction functions for
the disk distribution function. These functions are multiplicative
corrections to the surface density and vertical velocity dispersion
which appear to leading order in the Shu (1969) distribution
functions. See KD95 for details. The keywords
sigrv0, sigr0, ncorr, niter are used for this.
It also outputs the Toomre Q as a function of radius in the file
toomre.dat.
.PP
\fBgendisk, genbulge, genhalo\fP assembled the respective components
using an input file.
.PP
\fBmergerv\fP is a small shell script that merges the 3 ascii files.
.SH PERFORMANCE
The bulk of the CPU is in creating the disk particles, the bulge and halo are 
a much smaller fraction of the cpu. On a 1.6 GHz Pentium-4 laptop the cpu cost is
about \fI(Ndisk/1000)+32\fP secs for the gnu compiler (the 32 secs is to account for
building tables, which is independantly of the number of particles.

The default keywords are for Kuijken-Dubinski's model-A.

.TH AMUSE 1NEMO "23 May 2025"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBAMUSE\fP is the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment.
With it, you can simulate many astrophysical systems. It is written
in python, so there is currently no \fBamuse\fP command, instead you
will want to import this module in python and go from there.


.SH "EXAMPLES"

Here is an example snippet of python code integrating a Plummer sphere
and writing the resulting snapshot as a table

.EX

 N=128
 TIME=10
 FILENAME='p.txt'

 from amuse.units import nbody_system
 from amuse.ic.plummer import new_plummer_model
 from amuse.community.bhtree import Bhtree
 from amuse.io import write_set_to_file,read_set_from_file

 stars = new_plummer_model(N)
 gravity = Bhtree()

 eps = 0.025 | nbody_system.length
 tstop = 10  | nbody_system.time

 gravity.parameters.opening_angle  = 0.75
 gravity.parameters.epsilon_squared = eps * eps
 gravity.parameters.dt_dia          = 1.0      | nbody_system.time
 gravity.parameters.timestep        = 0.015625 | nbody_system.time 

 stars_in_gravity = gravity.particles.add_particles(stars)
 gravity.evolve_model(tstop)
 write_set_to_file(stars_in_gravity, FILENAME, format='txt')

.EE

This table has mass, radius, velocity and position, one per star. Thus the
following NEMO command will convert it to the standard
\fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP file:

.EX

 nbody=$(tabcols p.txt | wc -l)
 tabcols p.txt | tabtos - p.snap block1=mass,skip,vx,vy,vz,x,y,z nbody=$nbody

.EE


.SH "INSTALL"

Within NEMO the command
.EX

   mknemo amuse

.EE
will get you started on the install.  More to come.  Note there is a user release, which
can be a set of \fIpip install\fP only, as well as a developer install.

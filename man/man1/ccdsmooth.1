.TH CCDSMOOTH 1NEMO "10 May 2010"
.SH NAME
ccdsmooth \- smoothing of an image map (2D or 3D)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBccdsmooth in=\fPimage \fBout=\fPimage [parameter=value]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIccdsmooth\fP will smooth an image cube through a simple direct convolution
(no FFT). The smoothing beam must be circular/spherical, or smoothing
must be done independantly per coordinate by calling \fIccdsmooth\fP
multiple times using the \fBdir=\fP keyword (see below).
.PP
For more artistic versions of a smoothing operation, such as added
noise and diffraction spikes for bright stars, see \fIccddiffract(1NEMO)\fP.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.so man1/parameters
.TP 20
\fBin=\fIin-file\fP
input file, in \fIImage(5)\fP format [no default]
.TP
\fBout=\fIout-file\fP
output file, will be in \fIImage(5)\fP format [no default]
.TP
\fBgauss=\fIvalue\fP
Beam size (FWHM, note FWHM = 2*sqrt(2*ln(2)) = 2.355 * sigma) of a 
gaussian smoothing
kernel, in WCS units.
Note this is size of the used smoothing kernel, NOT the resulting
beam in the output map, which generally will be bigger depending on
the pre-existing beam. 
If this parameter is used, the parameter \fBsmooth\fP is
ignored [default: not used].
.TP
\fBdir=x|y|z\fP
Direction of smoothing. This gives the flexibility of smoothing in
x, y and/or z separately. Note that when smoothing in more than one
coordinate the \fIbeam\fP is forced to be the same in each dimension
[default: xy].
.TP
\fBsmooth=\fIarray\fP
Smoothing array, should be at least 1 number, prefarably normalized 
to unity for sake for conservation of units (mass per unit square
length). The program does not normalize the beam to unity.
Example is e.g. the Hanning smoothing: "0.25,0.5,0.25".
[default: \fB0.25,0.5,0.25\fP]. This parameter is only used if
\fBgauss\fP parameter is not used.
.TP
\fBnsmooth=\fIvalue\fP
Number of times the above smoothing kernel is applied over the data.
[default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBbad=\fIbad_value\fP
Input pixel value which to skip in smoothing.
[Default: not used]
.TP
\fBcut=\fIcutoff_value\fP
Value at which to cutoff the gaussian beam. 
[Default: \fB0.01\fP]

.SH "EXAMPLES"
Here is an example to compute the noise of an image with unity noise that has been smoothed
with a beam/pixel (B/P) ratio of 2.0 :
.nf

  ccdgen "" -  noise 0,1 size=1000,1000 seed=123 | ccdsmooth - - 2.0 | ccdstat - | grep dispersion
  Mean and dispersion    : -0.000116 0.334048

.fi
with the following table showing the resulting RMS for a few values of the B/P ratio
.nf

B/P     RMS
---    -----
0.0    1.000
1.0    0.796
2.0    0.334
3.0    0.223
4.0    0.168
5.0    0.1367
6.0    0.1160
7.0    0.1012
8.0    0.0917

.fi
caveat/TBD:   this does not follow the expected (?) 1/sqrt(1.1309)/(B/P)

sigma_smooth = -0.133 + 1.52 / beam

.SH "TIMING"
.nf
.ta +1.0i
With 68881 on SUN 3/50 (~16Mhz) and 200*200 map - old program (pre-V2.1)
Nbeam=17	54s
Nbeam=33	98s
Nbeam=47	140s

.SH "HANNING"
The following are the weights needed in smooth= for subsequent hanning smoothings:
.nf
1: 0.25,0.5,0.25
2: 0.0625,0.25,0.375,0.25,0.0625 
3: 0.015625,0.09375,0.234375,0.3125,0.234375,0.09375,0.015625 
4: 0.00390625,0.03125,0.109375,0.21875,0.273438,0.21875,0.109375,0.03125,0.00390625 
.fi
and these results in a reduction of the RMS by 0.61, 0.52, 0.47 and 0.44 resp.
Note this is not the official Hanning definition (0.5-0.5 cos(2.pi.N/(M-1))). 
.nf
1: 0.25,0.5,0.25
2: 0.08333333,0.25,0.33333333,0.25,0.08333333
3: 0.03661165,0.125,0.21338835,0.25,0.21338835,0.125,0.03661165,
4: 0.0190983,0.0690983,0.1309017,0.1809017,0.2,0.1809017,0.1309017,0.0690983,0.0190983
5: 0.01116455,0.04166667,0.08333333,0.125,0.15550212,0.16666667,0.15550212,0.125,0.08333333,0.04166667,0.01116455
.fi
which reduce the RMS by 0.61, 0.49, 0.43, 0.38 and 0.34 resp.

.SH "BUGS"
Smoothing a map which has already been smoothed will result in an incorrect
header - this would be a simple sum of squares, if the beams are aligned with the axis.

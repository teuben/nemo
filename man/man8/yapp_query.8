.TH YAPP_QUERY 8NEMO "12 July 2020"
.SH NAME
yapp_query \- show which yapp device(s) are installed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fByapp_query \fIdev1 ...\fP 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByapp_query\fP attempts to show which possible devices
are installed in NEMO, to make shell scripts more portable.
For example for the pgplot device list
.nf

       yapp_query png ps
       
.fi
would return the first device that is available. Here's an example of usage:

.nf
       dev=$(yapp_query png ps)
       tabplot 1.tab yapp=fig1.$dev/$dev
.fi
would be a more portable way. This is a common situation, where on redhat based
system the png driver is not installed, but on debian based it is (in 2021).

intro - introduction to <i>local</i> NEMO tools 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Description</a></h2>
This section describes
local programs and tools. They are sometimes useful to keep within NEMO,
but do not obey the NEMO user interface rules, and are often public domain
programs which we use. Not all programs listed here are actually still available
from within NEMO and you may have to hunt them down on internet.

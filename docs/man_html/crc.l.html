crck (version 2) - CRC value of files

<p>
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>

<p>
crck [-t|u|c|i] [filename ... ]

<p>
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Options</a></h2>


<dl>

<dt>-t </dt></dt>
<dd>Perform CRCK on a CP/M text file that is stored as a Unix file.
CP/M record delimiters (CR/LF) are substituted for Unix
newlines and the file is padded to a 128-byte sector boundary
with ^Z (0x1A).

<p></dd>

<dt>-u </dt></dt>
<dd>Perform CRCK on a regular Unix file. Takes whatever is there.
This is the default option.

<p></dd>

<dt>-c </dt></dt>
<dd>Perform CRCK on a CP/M non-text file (such as .COM or .LBR).
Handled the same as the -u flag except 128-byte sectors are
reported rather than bytes.

<p></dd>

<dt>-i </dt></dt>
<dd>Perform CRCK on a CP/M non-text file stored in ITS binary
format. Ignores the first four bytes of the file which contain
an ITS code.

<p></dd>
</dl>
<p>
Wildcards may, of course, be used and the program may be
used in pipelines.

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>

<p>
Crck calculates and prints a 16-bit CRC value and either a
CP/M 128-byte sector count or the byte count for the named
files. It is typically used to validate files transferred
between Unix and CP/M type operating systems. Crck uses a
CRC compatible with the CP/M and CP/M-86 versions of crck
prior to 5.0, as well as the crck command in 8 bit versions
of YAM (Yet Another Modem program).

<p><p>
When comparing copies of a text file on Unix and CP/M or
similar systems, account must be taken of the format of the
file on the Unix system to determine which option to use to
check the file. The file may be in CP/M format, with carriage
return/line feed line terminators and padding with
control-Z to make the length divisible by 128 (-u option);
or it may be in Unix format, with newline line delimiters
and no padding (-t option); or in ITS-binary format (-i
option).

<p><p>
Since CP/M binary files are not &lsquo;translated&rsquo; to Unix, these
may be checked directly. Note, though, that any binary file
to be sent to a CP/M system must have a length of a multiple
of 128 bytes to be checked correctly on both ends. If it
does not, the CP/M system will &lsquo;fill&rsquo; the rest of the last
128-byte record, and the CRC checks will be different, even
though the data transferred correctly.

<p>
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>

<p>
Prints proper usage if an incorrect flag is given.

<p>
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Bugs</a></h2>

<p>
Has not been rigorously tested. May not produce correct
results with all processor types. This CRC detects all single
bit errors and most, but not all, multiple bit errors.
This CRC does not detect all two bit errors, unlike the CRC
used with standard synchronous communications protocols.

<p>
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Warning</a></h2>

<p>
Files with different data may still produce the same crck

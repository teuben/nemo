CALC COMMAND LINE <p>

<dl>

<dt><b> -h</b> </dt>
<dd>Print a help message. This option implies <b> -q</b>. This is
equivalent to the calc command <b>help help</b>. </dd>

<dt><b> -q</b> </dt>
<dd>Disable the use of the <b>$CALCRC</b>
startup library scripts. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Without <b>calc_cmd</b>s, <b>calc</b> operates interactively.
If one or more <b>calc_cmd</b>s are given on the command line, <b>calc</b> will execute
them and exit. <p>
Normally on startup, <b>calc</b> attempts to execute a collection
 of library scripts. The environment variable <b>$CALCRC</b> (if non-existent then
a compiled in value) contains a <b>:</b> separated list of startup library scripts.
No error conditions are produced if these startup library scripts are not
found. <p>
Filenames are subject to &lsquo;&lsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo; expansion (see below). The environment
variable <b>$CALCPATH</b> (if non-existent then a compiled in value) contains a
<b>:</b> separated list of search directories. If a file does not begin with <b>/</b>,
<b>~</b> or <b>./</b>, then it is searched for under each directory listed in the <b>$CALCPATH</b>.
It is an error if no such readable file is found. <p>
For more information use
the following calc commands: <p>
 help usage <br>
help help <br>
help environment  <p>
OVERVIEW <p>
<b>Calc</b> is arbitrary precision arithmetic system
that uses  a C-like language. <b>Calc</b> is useful as a calculator, an algorithm
prototyped and as a mathematical research tool. More importantly, <b>calc</b> provides
one with a machine independent means of computation. <p>
A rich set of builtin
functions is provided. A number of library scripts are also provided because
they are useful and to serve as examples of the <b>calc</b> language. <p>
One may further
extend <b>calc</b> permits further thru to use of calc library scripts. Written
in the same C-like language, library scripts may be read in and executed
during a <b>calc</b> session. <p>
Internally calc represents numeric values as fractions
reduced to their lowest terms. The numerators and denominators of these
factions may grow to arbitrarily large values. Numeric values read in are
automatically converted into rationals. The user need not be aware of this
internal representation. <p>
For more information use the following calc commands:
<p>
 help intro <br>
help builtin <br>
help stdlib <br>
help define <br>
show builtins <br>
show functions  <p>
DATA TYPES <p>
Fundamental builtin data types include integers,
real numbers,  rational numbers, complex numbers and strings. <p>
By use of
an object, one may define an arbitrarily complex data types. One may define
how such objects behave a wide range of operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, negation, squaring, modulus, rounding, exponentiation,
equality, comparison, printing and so on. <p>
For more information use the following
calc commands: <p>
 help types <br>
help obj <br>
show objfuncs  <p>
VARIABLES <p>
Variables in <b>calc</b> are typeless. In other words,
the fundamental type of a variable is determined by its content. Before
variable is assigned a value is of type &lsquo;&lsquo;null&rsquo;&rsquo;. <p>
The scope of a variable may
be global, or only a local to a procedure. Values may be grouped together
in a matrix, or into a a list that permits stack and queue style operations.
<p>
For more information use the following calc commands: <p>
 help variable <br>
help mat <br>
help list <br>
show globals  <p>
INPUT/OUTPUT <p>
A leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0x&rsquo;&rsquo; implies a hexadecimal value, a
leading &lsquo;&lsquo;0b&rsquo;&rsquo; implies a binary value, and a &lsquo;&lsquo;0&rsquo;&rsquo; followed by a digit implies
an octal value. Complex numbers are indicated by a trailing &lsquo;&lsquo;i&rsquo;&rsquo; such as in
&lsquo;&lsquo;3+4i&rsquo;&rsquo;. Strings may be delimited by either a pair of single or double quotes.
By default, <b>calc</b> prints values as if they were floating point numbers. One
may change the default to print values in a number of modes including fractions,
integers and exponentials. <p>
A number of stdio-like file I/O operations are
provided. One may open, read, write, seek and close files. Filenames are
subject to &lsquo;&lsquo;~&rsquo;&rsquo; expansion to home directories in a way similar to that of
the Korn or C-Shell. <p>
For example: <p>
 ~/.calcrc <br>
~chongo/lib/fft_multiply.cal  <p>
For more information use the following calc
command: <p>
 help file  <p>
CALC LANGUAGE <p>
The <b>calc</b> language is a C-like language.
The language includes commands such as variable declarations,  expressions,
tests, labels, loops, file operations, function calls. These commands are
very similar to their counterparts in C. <p>
The language also include a number
of commands particular to <b>calc</b> itself. These include commands such as function
definition, help,  reading in library scripts, dump files to a file, error
notification,  configuration control and status. <p>
For more information use
the following calc command: <p>
 help command <br>
help statement <br>
help expression <br>
help operator <br>
help config  <p>

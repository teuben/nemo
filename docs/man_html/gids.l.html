gids - Groningen Image Display Server 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>gids</b> [-option value]... 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>gids</b>
is an X-windows display server program   that can display and manipulate
images, in particular store an unlimited amount of images from a cube and
display them in <i>movie</i> and  <i>slice</i> mode. (see also <a href='ds9.l.html'><i>ds9(lNEMO)</i></a>
 for a simple
standalone version now in more common use within NEMO) <p>
Clients talk to
this server using the <i>gdi</i> library. The server can also send information
back to the client, and it is up to the client to interpret this information.
The server also understand the PGPLOT plotting routines. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>
Command
line options are optional and of the form <i>-option value</i>. They are: 
<dl>

<dt><b>-display</b>
<i>server</i> </dt>
<dd>Display server to run on. Usualy X-windows syntax. By default, the
<b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable is used. </dd>

<dt><b>-memory</b> <i>size</i> </dt>
<dd>Size, in kilo-bytes, to
allocate for image frames. These are used to store images in movie and slice
mode. The maximum number of images is displayed in the <b>REC=</b> (third) window
on the GIDS server. By default, space for 3 512*512 images is allocated
(<i>size=768</i>). </dd>

<dt><b>-file</b> <i>setup_file</i> </dt>

MenusHere is a detailed listing of the online-available help menu. It is
activated in context-sensitive mode by pressing the middle mouse button
on any menu option. 
(0)           HELP
              GIDS is the Groningen Image Display Server. It will display
              two dimensional images which have to be loaded into GIDS
by a
              special program (i.e. the GIPSY program VIEW).
              MOUSE BUTTONS:
              Here we assume that button1 is the left-most mouse button,
              button2 the middle mouse button and button3 the right-most
              mouse button.
              To remove the HELP window, press HELP again with button1
or
              button3 or press a mouse button in the help window.
              DISPLAY WINDOW:
              In the display window the images are shown. At startup the
              display window is the right-most window with a size of 512
x 512.
              It is possible to resize this window. The minimum size is
              128 x 128, the maximum size depends on the size of the screen.
              Each resizing of the display window will remove all previous
              recordings.
              WEDGE WINDOW:
              To the left of the display window the wedge window is placed.
              This window displays the current color lookup table.
              CALIBRATION WINDOW:
              To the left of the wedge window the calibration window is
placed.
              Here the data values as a function of current color are
              displayed graphically.
              INFO WINDOWS:
              GIDS has 7 info windows which are placed in the upper-left
              window of GIDS (white on black). From top to bottom, the first
              two display info related to the image currently in the display
              window. This information depends on what the program which
loaded
              the image into GIDS found necessary to show the user.
              The third window displays information about the recordings
              (REC= MR, NR, CR), where MR is the maximum number of recordings
              the server can handle, NR the number of images recorded and
              CR the current record number in the display window. Record
0 is
              special since here always the last image loaded into GIDS
is
              stored. It is only possible to (de)zoom this image. Pressing
              the ETCETERA menu and then the RECORDING menu will show a
              list of recording options.
              The fourth window displays information about the graphics
planes
              (MASK=  M ON=  N), where M is the current mask of graphics
planes
              on which the graphics operation is valid and N the mask for
the
              planes which are displayed. GIDS has 4 graphics planes, which
are
              numbered 1, 2, 4 and 8. If more than one graphics plane is
wanted,
              simply add the numbers. Pressing the ETCETERA menu and then
the
              REGION menu will give a list of graphics plane operations.
              The fifth window displays the data value at the position
of the
              cursor in the display window (VAL=   N).
              The sixth window will display the grids at the position of
the
              cursor in the display window (POS=   X,   Y).
              The seventh window is an input window which displays the
text
              entered via the keyboard. Some menu actions need the text
in
              this window.
              MENU WINDOWS:
              Below the info windows menu windows are placed.
              Moving the pointer to a menu window will &rsquo;highlight&rsquo; it, clicking
              mouse button1 or button3 will activate it. Clicking button2
              will give help on the menu item.
              CUSTOMIZATION OF GIDS:
              GIDS allows the user to specify some defaults in the .Xdefaults
              or .Xresources file. The parameters which can be set are the
              following:
              gids.calibration_font:     font for calibration window.

menu).
              gids.scaling:              color transfer funtion as program
                                         start (use name of scaling funtion
                                         as from scale menu).
              gids.inverse_scaling:      True for negative slope of color
                                         transfer function.
              gids.autoraise:            Raise window when new image or

the
              display window.
              Pressing GRAPHICS again will remove the extra plot window
              and any plot output will again be redirected to the display
              window.
              The default plot window size is 512 x 512. The user can specify
              the size by typing the wanted X size and Y size (those numbers
              should appear in the lower info window) and then pressing
              GRAPHICS.
(6.2)         ETCETERA RECORDING
              Pressing RECORDING will activate the recording menu, where
              the user can manipulate the recorded images.
              The third info window displays information about the recordings
              (REC= MR, NR, CR), where MR is the maximum number of recordings
              the server can handle, NR the number of images recorded and
              CR the current record number in the display window. Record
0 is
              special since here always the last image loaded into GIDS
is
              stored. It is only possible to (de)zoom this image.
(6.2.0)       ETCETERA RECORDING RECORD
              Typing the wanted record number and pressing RECORD will
              record the image currently in the display window.

              Pressing button1 in the display window will show the previous
              recording, pressing button3 will display the next recording.
              When pressing VIEW, the default action is to show the current
              record number. Any other recording can be viewed by typing
its
              record number and then pressing VIEW.
(6.2.2)       ETCETERA RECORDING BLINK
              This option will allow the user to blink two images.
              Typing one or two record numbers and pressing BLINK will
              enter blink mode. If only one record number was typed, record
0
              will be used for the first recording and the record number
              entered for the second.
              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Pressing any button will set the time interval between blinks.
              Blink frequency increases to the left.
(6.2.3)       ETCETERA RECORDING LOOP
              This option will allow the user to make a movie of
              the recorded images.
              Typing the wanted record numbers and pressing LOOP will
              enter loop mode.
              Mouse Button Control in display window:

              Button2: set the loop speed. Speed increases to the left.
              Button3: Loop forward.
              NOTE: Some programs already define the loop for the user
              (i.e. the GIPSY program VIEW with RECORD=Y). The user
              then only needs to press LOOP and does not have to specify
              the record numbers.
(6.2.4)       ETCETERA RECORDING SPLIT
              This option will allow the user to view two images in split
              screen.
              Typing one or two record numbers and pressing SPLIT will
              enter split screen mode. In split screen mode gids displays
              in different parts of the display window the two recordings
              entered by the user. If only one record number was typed,
              record zero will be used for the first recording and the
              record number entered for the second.
              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Button1 will display to the left of the cursor the first
              recording entered by the user and to the right the second.

(6.3)         ETCETERA REGION
              Pressing REGION will display record number zero and activate
              the region menu.
              This option is only of use in combination with a special
              program which can do something useful with the graphics data
              (i.e. GIPSY program BLOT for masking data).
              The fourth info window displays information about the graphics
              planes (MASK=   M ON=  N), where M is the current mask of
              graphics planes on which the selected operation (i.e. DEFINE)
              is valid and N the mask for the planes which are displayed.
              GIDS has four graphics planes which are numbered 1, 2, 4
and 8.
              If the user wants more than one graphics plane simply add
the
              numbers.
              Graphics operations only work on the last image read into
GIDS.
(6.3.0)       ETCETERA REGION DEFINE
              Pressing DEFINE will allow the user to start defining a region
              on top of record zero. The graphics planes which will be modified

region
              which is to be removed from a previous defined region. The
              graphics planes which will be modified are shown in the fourth
              info window (MASK=).
              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Pressing Button1 for the first time will start the region
              (a polygon) to be removed on that position. The following
clicks
              on Button1 will draw the outer boundaries of the polygon
to be
              removed.
              Pressing Button2 will remove the last drawn boundaries.
              Pressing Button3 will close and remove the polygon.
(6.3.2)       ETCETERA REGION ON

              will display the graphics data in the planes which match
              the new ON mask.
(6.3.3)       ETCETERA REGION CLEAR
              Pressing CLEAR will clear the graphics planes which match
              the MASK shown in the fourth info window.
              The user can modify this mask by typing the wanted mask and
              pressing CLEAR.
(6.3.4)       ETCETERA REGION READY
              Press READY when finished with (un)defining regions. This

              slice menu.
              The slice menu allows the user to display cuts along a principal
              axis through all recordings. The xslice window (created with
              the X-SLICE option) displays an X-cut through all selected
              recordings. The yslice window (created with the Y-SLICE option)
              displays a Y-cut through all selected recordings.
              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Pressing any button will show in the xslice window (the window
              below the display window) an X-cut through all selected
              recordings at the present x position, and in the yslice window
              (the window to the right of the display window) a Y-cut through
              all selected recordings at the present y position.
              Mouse Button Control in xslice window:
              Pressing any button will show in the display window the

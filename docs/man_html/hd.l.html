hd - dump the contents of a file in hex 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>hd</b> [ name... ] <br>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
For each argument, <i>hd</i> dumps to standard output the contents
of the file in hex and ASCII, and the offsets into the file for each byte.
If no file is specified, the standard input is used. If one of the files
cannot be opened, a message is printed to that effect and the next file
is tried. <p>
Dumps from <i>hd</i> are meant to go to a printer, so form feed characters
are inserted to cause page ejects at the end of the page.  Pages are formatted
as follows:  At the top of the page is the name of the file being dumped
and the column headings.  The column headings label the offset of the byte
in that column from the address given at the beginning of the line containing
the byte. <p>
After the column headings, the dump of the file is presented. Each
line contains 16 bytes of data from the file.  The first item on the line
is the address within the file of the first byte of the line.  If the address
is preceded by a "+", then it is the beginning of a 512 byte block. <p>
The
next item on the line is the hexadecimal representation of the bytes in
the file.  For machines with the so-called "little-endian" architecture (eg.
VAXes, IBM PCs), the bytes are arranged right to left, that is, the byte
whose address is given at the beginning of the line is at the rightmost
part of the hex dump.  For machines with "big-endian" architectures (eg. Sun
Workstations), the bytes are arranged left to right.  <p>
Following the hex
dump is the ASCII dump.  It is always arranged left to right.  Characters
which are not printable (eg. control characters) are represented by a ".".
<p>
When the end of file is reached, <i>hd</i> starts a new page. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Bugs</a></h2>
On MS-DOS machines,
most C standard I/O libraries do newline conversion, that is, a \r\n sequence
is turned into a single \n.  This is corrected when reading from files which
are given on the command line, but not when reading from stdin. <p>
This manual
page uses the term ASCII when it really shouldn&rsquo;t.  Hd will compile and run
properly on an EBCDIC machine, since &lt;ctype.h&gt; and isprint() are used.

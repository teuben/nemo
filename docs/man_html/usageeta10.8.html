<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
usageeta10 - a very short and simple instruction list for ETA 10 users.

<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Description</a></h2>
After having read <a href='usage205.8NEMO.html'><i>usage205(8NEMO)</i></a>
 you can continue with this
document, as the submission of jobs is very much like that on the ETA10.
<p>
A special command file <b>HACK_ETA.COM</b>, written by the JVNC staff, will do
the job for the moment. It operates much like a pep-file, except that the
VAX file names of the input files to  the treecode (<b>TREEPARS</b> for the  parameters
and <b>TREEBODI</b> for the initial conditions of the N bodies) will be given
to the command file. No <b>PEPPUT</b> is required here (this was just a matter
of how the command file was written). <p>
At the moment of writing, being in
<i>friendly user period</i> you have to ask the operators to submit the job for
you. This is still a highly personalized way of working, and I shall not
further discuss it here until a more independant way of submitting jobs
has been announced.

.SH DESCRIPTION<br>

.B mkisofs<br>

is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate the iso9660 filesystem - it
takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a binary image which
will correspond to an iso9660 filesystem when written to a block device.
.PP<br>

.B mkisofs<br>

is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified
by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. This is used to further describe the
files in the iso9660 filesystem to a unix host, and provides information such
as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix permissions, and block and character
devices.<br>

.PP<br>


<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Each file written to the iso9660 filesystem must have a filename in the 8.3</a></h2>

<p>
format (8 characters, period, 3 characters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge
is in use. This filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each filename in each directory
must be different from the other filenames in the same directory.
.B mkisofs<br>

generally tries to form correct names by forcing the unix filename to upper
case and truncating as required, but often times this yields unsatisfactory
results when there are cases where the<br>

truncated names are not all unique.<br>

.B mkisofs<br>

assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the
same are found the name with the lower priority is renamed to have a 3 digit
number as an extension (where the number is guaranteed to be unique). An
example of this would be the files foo.bar and
foo.bar.~1~ - the file foo.bar.~1~ would be written as FOO.000;1 and the file
foo.bar would be written as FOO.BAR;1<br>

.PP<br>


<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Note that</a></h2>

<p>
.B mkisofs<br>

is not designed to communicate with the writer directly. Most writers
have proprietary command sets which vary from one manufacturer to
another, and you need a specialized tool to actually burn the disk.

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>The</a></h2>

<p>
.B cdwrite<br>

utility is one such tool that runs under Linux and performs this task.

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>The latest version of</a></h2>

<p>
.B cdwrite<br>

is capable of communicating with Phillips/IMS/Kodak, HP and Yamaha drives.

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Most writers come with some version of DOS software that allows a direct image</a></h2>

<p>
copy of an iso9660 image to the writer. The current version of
.B cdwrite<br>

is available from sunsite.unc.edu: /utils/disk-management/cdwrite-2.0.tar.gz
.PP<br>


<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Also you should know that most cd writers are very particular about timing.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot let their buffer empty before you</a></h2>

<p>
are done, or you will end up with a corrupt disc. Thus it is critical
that you be able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the writer
for the entire time that the disc is being written.
.PP<br>

.br<br>

.B path<br>

is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the iso9660 filesystem.
.SH OPTIONS<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-a<br>


<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Include all files on the iso9660 filesystem. Normally files that contain the</a></h2>

<p>
characters &lsquo;~&rsquo; or &lsquo;#&rsquo; will not be included (these are typically backup files
for editors under unix).<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-A application_id<br>


<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>This should describe the application that will be on the disc. There</a></h2>

<p>
is space on the disc for 128 characters of information. This parameter can
also be set in the file<br>

.I \&amp;.mkisofsrc<br>

with APPI=id.<br>


<h2><a name='sect10' href='#toc10'>If specified in both places, the command line version is used.</a></h2>

<p>
.TP<br>

.I \-b boot_image<br>


<h2><a name='sect11' href='#toc11'>Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when making</a></h2>

<p>
an &ldquo;El Torito&rdquo; bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to<br>

.B mkisofs.<br>


<h2><a name='sect12' href='#toc12'>This option is required to make a bootable CD.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect13' href='#toc13'>The boot image must be exactly the size of either a 1.2, 1.44, or a 2.88</a></h2>

<p>
meg floppy, and<br>

.B mkisofs<br>

will use this size when creating the output iso9660
filesystem. It is assumed that the first 512 byte sector should be read
from the boot image (it is essentially emulating a normal floppy drive).

<h2><a name='sect14' href='#toc14'>This will work, for example, if the boot image is a LILO based boot floppy.</a></h2>

<p>
.TP<br>

.I \-c boot_catalog<br>


<h2><a name='sect15' href='#toc15'>Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to be used when making</a></h2>

<p>
an &ldquo;El Torito&rdquo; bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to<br>

.B mkisofs.<br>


<h2><a name='sect16' href='#toc16'>This option is required to make a bootable CD.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect17' href='#toc17'>This file will be created by</a></h2>

<p>
.B mkisofs<br>

in the source filesystem, so be<br>

sure the specified filename does not conflict with an existing file, as
it will be quietly overwritten! Usually a name like &ldquo;boot.catalog&rdquo; is
chosen.<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-d<br>


<h2><a name='sect18' href='#toc18'>Omit trailing period from files that do not have a period. This violates the</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect19' href='#toc19'>ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems. Use with caution.</a></h2>

<p>
.TP<br>

.I \-D<br>


<h2><a name='sect20' href='#toc20'>Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just pack them in the</a></h2>

<p>
way we see them. This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it works on many
systems. Use with caution.<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-f<br>


<h2><a name='sect21' href='#toc21'>Follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem. When this option is not</a></h2>

<p>
in use, symbolic links will be entered using Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise
the file will be ignored.<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-i include-list<br>


<h2><a name='sect22' href='#toc22'>Use the specified file as a list of files to add to the directory tree.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect23' href='#toc23'>This is useful for quickly repacking a CD while adding files to it.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect24' href='#toc24'>The format of this file is path1/file=path2 where path1 is the directory</a></h2>

<p>
in the ISO9660 file system where file should appear and path2 is the
where to find the file. NOTE: This option doesn&rsquo;t work well, and
needs to be compltely redone so that integration with the rest of mkisofs
is handled in a cleaner fashion.<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-l<br>


<h2><a name='sect25' href='#toc25'>Allow full 32 character filenames. Normally the ISO9660 filename will be in an</a></h2>

<p>
8.3 format which is compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO9660 standard
allows filenames of up to 32 characters. If you use this option, the disc may
be difficult to use on a MS-DOS system, but this comes in handy on some other
systems (such as the Amiga). Use with caution.
.TP<br>

.I \-L<br>


<h2><a name='sect26' href='#toc26'>Allow filenames to begin with a period. Usually, a leading dot is</a></h2>

<p>
replaced with an underscore in order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
.TP<br>

.I \-m glob<br>


<h2><a name='sect27' href='#toc27'>Exclude</a></h2>

<p>
.I glob<br>

from being written to CDROM.<br>

.I glob<br>

is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match part of the filename (not
the path as with option<br>

.BR -x ).<br>


<h2><a name='sect28' href='#toc28'>Technically</a></h2>

<p>
.I glob<br>

is matched against the<br>

.I d-&gt;d_name<br>

part of the directory entry.<br>


<h2><a name='sect29' href='#toc29'>Multiple globs may be excluded (up to 1000).</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect30' href='#toc30'>Example:</a></h2>


<p><p>
mkisofs \-o rom \-m &lsquo;*.o&rsquo; \-m core \-m foobar

<p><p>
would exclude all files ending in &ldquo;.o", called &ldquo;core&rdquo; or &ldquo;foobar&rdquo; to be
copied to CDROM. Note that if you had a directory called &ldquo;foobar&rdquo; it too (and
of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
.TP<br>

.I \-M path<br>


<h2><a name='sect31' href='#toc31'>Specifies path to existing iso9660 image to be merged. The output</a></h2>

<p>
of<br>

.B mkisofs<br>

will be a new session which should get written to the end of the
image specified in -M. Typically this requires multi-session capability
for the recorder and cdrom drive that you are attempting to write this
image to. Support for this is not yet 100% complete, because some handshaking
is required between mkisofs and cdwrite in order to determine the next
writable address on the cdrom.<br>

.TP<br>

.I \-N<br>


<h2><a name='sect32' href='#toc32'>Omit version numbers from ISO9660 file names. This may violate the ISO9660</a></h2>

<p>
standard, but no one really uses the version numbers anyway. Use with caution.
.TP<br>

.I \-o filename<br>

is the name of the file to which the iso9660 filesystem image should be
written. This can be a disk file, a tape drive, or it can correspond directly
to the device name of the optical disc writer. If not specified, stdout is
used. Note that the output can also be a block special device for a regular
disk drive, in which case the disk partition can be mounted and examined to
ensure that the premastering was done correctly.
.TP<br>

.I \-P publisher_id<br>


<h2><a name='sect33' href='#toc33'>Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.</a></h2>


<h2><a name='sect34' href='#toc34'>This should describe the publisher of the CDROM, usually with a</a></h2>

<p>
mailing address and phone number. There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information. This parameter can also be set in the file
.I \&amp;.mkisofsrc<br>

with PUBL=.<br>

<h2><a name='sect40' href='#toc40'>This is like the \-R option, but file ownership and modes are set to</a></h2>

<p>
more useful values. The uid and gid are set to zero, because they are
usually only useful on the author&rsquo;s system, and not useful to the
client. All the file read bits are set true, so that files and
directories are globally readable on the client. If any execute bit is
set for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables are
globally executable on the client. If any search bit is set for a
directory, set all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client. All write bits are cleared, because the

<h2><a name='sect41' href='#toc41'>CD-Rom will be mounted read-only in any case. If any of the special</a></h2>

<p>
mode bits are set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only file system, and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or
gid 0.<br>

is not based on the standard mk*fs tools for unix, because we must generate
a complete copy of an existing filesystem on a disk in the iso9660
filesystem. The name mkisofs is probably a bit of a misnomer, since it
not only creates the filesystem, but it also populates it as well.

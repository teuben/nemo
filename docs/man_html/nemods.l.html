<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
Upgraded for NEMO,
it now also reads NEMO image files. <p>
DS uses the upper left corner as origin,
a Y-flip is needed for those of you who are used to having it in the lower
left corner. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>
<p>
Most options can be specified in two forms, a short
form and a long form. <p>
The file named <b>filnam</b> is displayed.  This name may
possibly be a name meaniful only to some package, like an <font size='-1'>AIPS</font>
 file name
(See Section on File names). If no <b>filnam</b> argument is specified then a name
of BLANK512x512 is assumed which is a dummy file which containing a 512
by 512 array of zeroed pixels. <p>
If the <b>-zlow</b> or (alternately) <b>-l</b> option is
not present then the next positional argument is interpreted as <b>lowpixvalue</b>
which has the same meaning as the <b>-zlow</b> option (see below). <p>
Likewise if the
<b>-zhigh</b> or (alternately) <b>-h</b> option is not present then the next positional
argument is interpreted as <b>highpixvalue</b> which has the same meaning as the
<b>-zhigh</b> option (see below).  
<dl>

<dt><b>-debug</b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-d</b></dt>
<dd>Turn on the debugging flag.  This generates
volumnious information on the standard error output that is sometimes useful
for debugging <i>ds</i>.  </dd>

<dt><b>-mono</b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-m</b></dt>
<dd>Force the display into monochrome mode, even if
<i>ds</i> is being run from a color display.  In monochrome mode a dithered array
of black or white pixels is generated to represent a picture and all color
facilities are disabled other than switching between a positive or a negative
(inverted) display.  </dd>

<dt><b>-xflip</b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-x</b></dt>
<dd>Flip the picture horizontally. This changes the
origin from its default position on the left of the window to instead be
on the right.  </dd>

<dt><b>-yflip</b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-y</b></dt>
<dd>Flip the picture vertically. This changes the origin
from its default position on the top of the window to instead be on the
bottom.  </dd>

<dt><b>-xyflip</b></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-xy</b></dt>
<dd>Interchange the vertical and horizontal axes.  The location
of the origin on the window is unchanged.  </dd>

<dt><b>-zlow</b> <i>lowpixvalue</i></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-l</b> <i>lowpixvalue</i></dt>
<dd>Set
the low pixel value for scaling to <i>lowpixvalue</i>. Exponential form (3.4.e-2 for
example) is allowed.  <i>lowpixvalue</i> and <i>highpixvalue</i> together set the scaling
between the displayed pixels and the pixels contained in the original picture.
 If <b>color</b> is <i>positive</i> then <i>lowpixvalue</i> corresponds to a black display and
<i>highpixvalue</i> corresponds to a white display.  <i>highpixvalue</i> can be lower
than <i>lowpixvalue</i> in which case a negative display will be obtained.  </dd>

<dt><b>-zhigh</b>
<i>highpixvalue</i></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-h</b> <i>highpixvalue</i></dt>
<dd>Set the high pixel value for scaling to <i>highpixvalue</i>.
 Exponential form (3.4.e-2 for example) is allowed.  <i>lowpixvalue</i> and <i>highpixvalue</i>
together set the scaling between the displayed pixels and the pixels contained
in the original picture.  If <b>color</b> is <i>positive</i> then <i>lowpixvalue</i> corresponds
to a black display and <i>highpixvalue</i> corresponds to a white display.  <i>highpixvalue</i>
can be lower than <i>lowpixvalue</i> in which case a negative display will be
obtained.  </dd>

<dt><b>-zoom</b> <i>zoomvalue</i></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-z</b> <i>zoomvalue</i></dt>
<dd>Set the initial value of the zoom factor
of the display.  If the zoom factor is equal to 1 then one pixel on the
displayed picture corresponds to one pixel on the display. A zoom factor
of 2 produces a times 2 magnification with one pixel in the picture interpreted
as a 2 by 2 array of pixels on the display. Magnification is currently done
by pixel duplication. Negative zoom factors are interpreted as being the
reciprical of their abolute value.  For example a zoom factor of -2 produces
a times two reduction in size with a 2 by 2 array of pixels in the picture
corresponding to 1 pixel on the display. Reduction is currently done by
pixel averaging with the pixel on the display being the average of the
corresponding pixels in the picture. Currently the initial zoom factor must
be a value for which the picture will fit on the screen. Otherwise the zoom
value will be decreased to such a value. The default initial zoom value
is 1.  </dd>

<dt><b>-range</b> <i>colormapsize</i></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-r</b> <i>colormapsize</i></dt>
<dd>Set the number of colors used to
display the picture on a color or grey/level display.  This must be a power
of two and be less than or equal to 256.  The default value is 128.  A <i>colormapsize</i>
of 1 is equivalent to the <b>-mono</b> option, setting the display into monochrome
mode.  </dd>

<dt><b>-color</b> <i>colormapselection</i></dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt><b>-c</b> <i>colormapselection</i></dt>
<dd> </dd>
</dl>
<p>
<i>ds</i> also accepts all of
the generic tool arguments discussed in <a href='suntools.1.html'><i>suntools</i>(1)</a>
. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Subwindows</a></h2>
<p>
<i>ds</i> consists
of up to four subwindows. 
<dl>

<dt>control panel</dt>

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Control Panel Items</a></h2>
 
<dl>

<dt>File Name Text Item</dt>
<dd>This item shows the name
of the file currently displayed and can be used to select another file
to display. To select this item: point the cursor at it and press the left
mouse button. A triangular blinking cursor will appear to the right of the
file name. To prevent accidental changing of the file file, the triangular
cursor will not appear in this item unless it has been explicitly selected.
With the mouse cursor then still inside the control panel the keyboard
can be used to change the file name. The old file name can be cleared out
with your line kill character (usually control U or control X) or your
delete character (usually Delete or backspace). The file name entered here
may possibly be a name meaniful only to some package, like an <font size='-1'>AIPS</font>
 file
name (See Section on File names). When carriage return is pressed <b>ds</b> will
be notified to load the new file. If the new file can not be found the old
file will continue to be displayed.  When the new file is being loaded the
cursor will be replaced by a cursor shaped like an hourglass, to indicate
that <b>ds</b> is busy and the message "loading file..." will appear in the message
item.  </dd>

<dt>Z Low Text Item</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Z High Text Item</dt>
<dd>These are the two Z boundary items.
The value of these two items determine the mapping between pixel values
in the original picture file and the brightnesses and colors shown on the
screen. Ordinarily value of the Z Low Text Item corresponds to pixels that
are displayed as black and the value of the Z High Text Item corresponds
to pixels thatat are displayed as white, yielding a positive display (currently
the only exception to this statement is when the Colormap Cycle Item has
a value of Negative. Then the sense of the statement is reversed: Z Low
pixels are white and Z High Pixels are black). However a Z Low Text Item
value higher that the value of the Z High Text Item is legal, yielding
a negative or color inverted display. Exponential form (3.4.e-2 for example)
is allowed and is useful if the picture contains floating point pixels.
The keyboard can be used to change the value of the item if the mouse cursor
is inside the control panel and a triangular blinking cursor is present
in the item.  If the triangular cursor is not there already, it can be brought
to the item by selecting the item (pointing to it with the mouse cursor
and pressing the left mouse button). The old value can be cleared with your
line kill character (usually control U or control X) or your delete character
(usually Delete or backspace). Then the new value can be entered. Pressing
carriage return notifies <b>ds</b> of your new value and sends the triangular
cursor over to the other Z boundary Text item (the triangular cursor can
only be moved to the File Name Text Item by selecting it explicitly). The
new value will not be applied to the display of the picture until the Repaint
Button Item on the control panel is invoked.  </dd>

<dt>Zoom Factor Slider Item</dt>
<dd>This
item controls the value of the zoom factor. Position the cursor inside the
rectangular box (the "slider rectangle") and press the left mouse button.
Move the cursor to the left or the right until the zoom factor (given in
square brackets to the left of the slider rectangle) has the value desired.
 Then release the left mouse button and the display will be readjusted
to the new zoom factor.  The operation can be aborted and the previous zoom
factor retained by moving the cursor out of the slider rectangle before
releasing the left mouse button.  </dd>

<dt>Colormap Cycle Item</dt>
<dd> </dd>

<dt>X flip toggle</dt>
<dd>Point
cursor at this item and press left mouse button to change the value of
the X flip toggle. Changing the value of the X flip toggle flips the picture
horizontally. When the X flip toggle is off the origin is on the left side
of the window. When the X flip toggle is on the origin is on the right side
of the window.  </dd>

<dt>Y flip toggle</dt>
<dd>Point cursor at this item and press left mouse
button to change the value of the Y flip toggle. Changing the value of the
Y flip toggle flips the picture vertically. When the Y flip toggle is off
the origin is on the top side of the window. When the Y flip toggle is on
the origin is on the bottom side of the window.  </dd>

<dt>XY flip toggle</dt>
<dd>Point cursor
at this item and press left mouse button to change the value of the XY
flip toggle. Changing the value of the XY flip toggle flips the picture
on a diagonal line through the picture, interchanging the horizontal and
vertical axes. The location of the origin on the window is unchanged.  The
XY flip is applied before the X and Y flips.  Thus an X flip will always
interchange the left and right hand sides of the display and a Y flip will
always interchange the top and bottom of the display. When the XY flip toggle
is off the pixel rows in the picture run horizontally. When the XY flip
toggle is on the pixel rows in the picture run vertically.  </dd>

<dt>Blank Button</dt>
<dd>Point
cursor at this "button" and press left mouse button to invoke the screen
blanking feature intended for use with hard copy devices.  A window the
color of the background (usually black) appears covering the whole screen.
In its center is a window on the picture being displayed at the current
pan and zoom.  For more information see the subsection on "Blanking Feature".
 </dd>

<dt>Repaint Button</dt>
<dd>Point cursor at this "button" and press left mouse button
to repaint the image in the picture canvas.  This is generally used after
the brightness scaling factors "Z Low" or "Z High" have been changed to
show the image with the new scaling.  </dd>

<dt>Quit Button</dt>
<dd>Point cursor at this "button"
and press left mouse button to exit ds. A confirmer window will appear. 
Press the left mouse button a second time to confirm the quit or press
the right mouse button to cancel the quit.  </dd>

<dt>Help Button</dt>
<dd>Point cursor at this
"button" and press left mouse button for help on the various features in
ds. At the moment all that happens is the message appears in the message
item "help not yet implemented". Pressing the help button will eventually
bring up popup menu of items for which help is requested.  </dd>

<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>1) Iraf:</dt>
<dd>These files
are generated by the IRAF image processing package. If filnam is a string
of characters (uppercase/lowercase significant) then filnam or filnam.imh
(with a .imh extension) are recognized.  The accompanying .pix file (which
must exist) is located by reading the header in the .imh file.  Hostname
prefixes in the .pix file name are currently ignored. </dd>

<dt>2) Fits:</dt>
<dd>These files
disk images of images in the FITS tape transmission standard. The file name
recognized is the same as the name of the disk file used to store the images.
</dd>

<dt>3) Sun Raster:</dt>
<dd>These files are in the standard form for picture storage
used by Sun Microsystems software. The file name recognized is the same
as the name of the disk file used to store the images. Either 8 bit or 1
bit monochrome images are recognized. </dd>

<dt>4) Aips:</dt>
<dd>These files are generated
by the AIPS image processing package. The name can either be the name of
the actual image head (of the form CBBxxxxx.xxx;1 ) or the AIPS catalog
name. The AIPS catalog name  is constructed in the form aipsname&lsquo;class&lsquo;seqno&lsquo;aipsid
.  A backquote separates the name sections.  A doubled backquote is interpreted
as a single backquote in a name section.  The "aipsid" name section is optional
and if omitted it defaults to the user&rsquo;s uid number from the /etc/passwd
file.  If the "seqno" section is omitted then the picture with an otherwise
matching name that has with the highest seqno will be used.  A name or class
of * will match any name or class. An omitted class is equivalent to a class
of *. the search for an aips catalog (file name beginning with the letters
"CAA") begins in the current directory.  If that fails the search continues
at directories pointed to by environment variables DA01, DA01, DA02, ... DA0n.
 The search terminates when the file is found or when an environment variable
does not exist. </dd>
</dl>
<p>
An added feature is that FITS files which are more than
2D can still be displayed, although currently only the first slice will
be displayed. Assuming FORTRAN oriented arrays. 
<dl>

<dt>5) NMR picture:</dt>
<dd>These files
are used to store NMR images from the Laurie Imaging center.  The file name
recognized is the same as the name of the disk file used to store the images.
 The file consists of 256 x 256 2 byte pixels offset by a 2048 byte header.
Pixels are in byte-swapped order, i.e. the less significant byte is first.
</dd>

<dt>8) NEMO image file:</dt>
<dd>These files are created by the image utilities in the
NEMO dynamics toolbox package. In case the image is more than 2D, only the
first slice will be displayed. </dd>

<dt>7) blank file:</dt>
<dd>Generates a picture filled
with zero pixels. This picture can be used as a simple default or as a blank
background for graphics.  The file name consists of the letters BLANK followed
optionally by a single number or by two numbers separated by the letter
"x". The name BLANK generates a 512 by 512 pixel blank picture.  The name
BLANKn where "n" is a number generates an n by n pixel blank picture.  The
name BLANKnxm where n and m are numbers generates an n by m pixel blank
picture. </dd>

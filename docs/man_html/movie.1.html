<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>movie</b> reads a set of rasterfiles (see
<a href='rasterfile.5.html'><i>rasterfile(5)</a>
)</i> and stores them in memory.  It provides a number of functions
for animating the sequence of rasters on the SUN bitmap display.  These
functions are described in the <b>Playback Functions</b> section below. <p>
<b>movie</b> <i>does</i>
not run under SUN-Windows. It uses the mouse for frame and speed control,
as well as menu selection of playback functions. <p>
<b>movie_sv</b> is a special version
which <i>can</i> run under SUN-windows, but is really intended for small (say 256
pixels square) images because of memory limitations. It&rsquo;s user interface
is also rather limited: a keyboard command interface instead of mouse control.
<p>
In <b>movie</b> the screen is divided into 5 areas.  The left square part of the
screen (900 * 900 pixels) is the frame area. All rasters are displayed here.
The right part of the screen comprises a single information line at the
top of the screen, a mouse button line, a menu area, and a menu page selection
area. <p>
The information line displays the currently displayed frame number,
the number of the last frame, and a speed indicator.  The speed controls
the frame presentation rate during playback.  The speed is shown as a number
between 0 and 100.  A speed of 0 indicates no motion. A speed of 100 indicates
the maximum possible redisplay rate.  When frames are being presented in
reverse sequence, as in a <b>Backward Loop,</b> the speed is shown as a negative
number. <p>
The mouse button line shows the status of the three mouse buttons.
The line is divided into 3 areas, corresponding to the left, centre, and
right mouse buttons.  The effect of pressing one of the buttons is indicated
in the appropriate area. <p>
The menu is displayed below the mouse button line.
 Each menu item is shown in a reverse video line.  The menu cursor moves
up and down through the menu, and reverses the bits in the line under the
cursor. <p>
The menu page selection area is at the bottom of the menu.  It has
two areas, labeled &lsquo;+&rsquo; and &lsquo;-&rsquo;, which will switch to the next or previous menu
page.  This feature unnecessary for <b>movie,</b> as only the first menu page has
any &lsquo;live&rsquo; entries, but is there for future expansion.  The menu contains
16 pages, each of 32 menu items.  The current page number is displayed to
the right of the &lsquo;-&rsquo; selector. <p>
Mouse motion is up/down to select menu items.
 Playback functions generally take up/down motions to cause increase/decrease
in playback speed, and left/right motions to indicate previous/next frame
selection. <p>
The position of the upper left corner of displayed frames may
be set by the command line <b>-p</b> option.  The following two integers are taken
as row and column offsets. <p>
By default <b>movie</b> will read rasterfiles from the
current directory. Files with names of the form <i>frame.#</i> (where # is a number)
are read into memory.  The files must be numbered sequentially, beginning
with frame.0.  This is similar to the convention used by the SUN demo program
<b>framedemo,</b> but note that in this case the files are in <i>rasterfile</i> format.
The <b>-s</b> option overrides the reading of the &lsquo;frame.#&rsquo; files.  The argument following
the <b>-s</b> option indicates a file to be read, which contains a list of rasterfiles
to read in sequence. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Playback Functions</a></h2>
<b>First Frame</b> <br>
Displays the first frame <p>
<b>Next Frame</b> <br>
Displays the next frame in the sequence, without wrap-around. <p>
<b>Previous Frame</b>
<br>
Displays the previous frame in the sequence, without wrap-around. <p>
<b>Last Frame</b>
<br>
Displays the last frame in the sequence. <p>
<b>Single Frame</b> <br>
Single frame playback. The left and right mouse buttons select the previous
and next frames. <p>
<b>Forward Play Once</b> <br>
Plays the sequence from first to last frame once, at the current frame
speed. <p>
<b>Backward Play Once</b> <br>
Plays the sequence from last to first frame once, at the current frame
speed. <p>
<b>Forward Loop</b> <br>
Play the sequence continually, from first to last frame.  The playback speed
may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or with the left and right mouse
buttons. <p>
<b>Backward Loop</b> <br>
Play the sequence continually, from last to first frame.  The playback speed
may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or with the left and right mouse
buttons. <p>
<b>Back and Forth Loop</b> <br>
Play the sequence continually, from first to last, then last to first frame.
 The playback speed may be adjusted with up/down mouse motion, or with
the left and right mouse buttons. <p>
<b>Variable Speed Loop</b> <br>
Play the sequence continually, The playback speed may be adjusted with
up/down mouse motion, or with the left and right mouse buttons. The playback
direction may be changed by moving the speed through 0.  Negative speed
indicates reverse playback. <p>
<b>Scroll With Mouse</b> <br>
Frames are displayed one at a time.  Left/right mouse motion displays previous/next
frames. <p>
<b>Position Frame</b> <br>
Allows the upper left starting position of displayed frames to be adjusted
interactively.  A box is drawn around the frame, and moved within the frame
area with mouse motion.  Pressing the left mouse button causes frame display
to take place at the new position. <p>
<b>Reverse Frame Video</b> <br>
Reverses the black/white sense of displayed frames. <p>
<b>Quit</b> <br>
Exits the <b>movie</b> program. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Acknowledgement</a></h2>
The playback functions in <b>movie</b>
are similar to the <b>S-Dynamics</b> animation playback program on our <b>Symbolics
3650.</b> I thank the authors of that software for giving me the idea to write
this one.   This program is, however, in no way copied or translated from
that code. 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Bugs</a></h2>
movie_sv does not work well on colour monitors, however by
closing to movie window into an icon and opening it again, it seems to
work... This is a native suntools bug.

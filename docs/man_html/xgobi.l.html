<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>xgobi</i> is an interactive dynamic graphics program for data visualization
in the X Window System.  It is especially designed for the exploration of
multivariate data. Its basic plot is a scatterplot, and these are some of
the tools available for scatterplot display and manipulation: <blockquote><p>
Cycling rapidly
through two-variable scatter plots. <p>
Three-dimensional rotation, including
trackball control. <p>
Grand tour rotation: a smooth randomized sequence of
two-dimensional projections in order to explore a higher-dimensional point
cloud. <p>
Brushing: the ability to change the color or plotting character of
a point or a group of points. <p>
Scaling: moving and reshaping the plot interactively.
<p>
Identification: displaying an label next to a point in the plot window.
<p>
Linking:  Brushing, identification and touring are linked; that is, actions
in the window of one XGobi process are immediately reflected in another
XGobi window displaying the same data. <p>
Line editing: Any pair of points
can be connected with a line segment. <p>
Transformation:  A menu of data transformations
is available. <p>
Postscript plotting:  The contents of the plot windows can
be written out to postscript files for high-quality plotting. <p>
Online help:
 Most of the XGobi buttons and windows have associated help files that
can be displayed during an XGobi session.  Click on the Help button toward
the top right of the window for instructions. </blockquote>
<p>
XGobi has a direct manipulation
interface, and all the above actions are performed using the mouse. <p>
XGobi
can be used in conjunction with <a href='S.1.html'>S (1)</a>
.  Execute <i>help(xgobi)</i> within S for
information. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>
<p>
<b>-std</b> mmx|msd|mmd <p>
<blockquote>By default, the data are scaled into the
plotting window using the minimum and maximum values of each variable or
variable group, in such a way that the midpoint of the variable is at the
center of the plotting window and no points fall outside the window.  Instead,
to scale using mean and standard deviation, specify  <i>-std</i> <i>msd;</i> to scale
using the median and median absolute deviation, specify <i>-std</i> <i>mmd.</i> </blockquote>
<p>
<b>-dev</b> x <blockquote><p>
If
you have specified  <i>-std</i> <i>msd</i> or <i>-std</i> <i>mmd,</i> then you can also specify the number
of standard deviations (or median absolute deviations) from the mean (or
median) to be contained within the plotting window, using the argument
<i>-dev</i> <i>x,</i> where  <i>x</i> is a real number between 0 and 100.  The default is 2. </blockquote>
<p>
X
options <p>
<blockquote>The standard X command line options can be used with XGobi. These
include  <i>-display machinename:0</i>, used when running an X program on one machine
and displaying its output on another, and <i>-title Title</i>, where <i>Title</i> is a
string you want to appear in the window manager titlebar. </blockquote>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Files</a></h2>
XGobi accepts
standard input, but is most often used with files, partly because of the
additional plot control that can be achieved using a set of files.  The
data input file should be an ASCII file with the data matrix arranged in
rows and columns; rows must be distinguished by carriage returns, and columns
can be separated by any amount of white space.  (The input file can also
be a binary file, which can be produced within XGobi once the ASCII data
has been read in.) XGobi accepts other input about the display of the data
from files as well. <p>
If the data is in a file named <b>filename</b> or <b>filename.dat</b>
(either of which must be an ASCII file), or <b>filename.bin</b> (the binary version
of the data), then the other files are as follows:  <p>
<br>
<pre>filename.rowfilename.rowlabfilename.case</pre><blockquote><p>
Row or case labels: a label for each
row of the data matrix, which is displayed in the identification mode. 
The file should contain one label per line. <p>
</blockquote>
 <p>
<br>
<pre>filename.colfilename.collabfilename.columnfilename.var</pre><blockquote><p>
Column or variable labels:
a label for each column of the data matrix, which becomes part of the XGobi
variable selection panel. The file should contain one label per line. </blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.colors</b>
<blockquote><p>
Brushing colors: a color for each point in the plot, representing a row
or case of the data. The file should contain one color per line.  (It is
probably best if the colors correspond to the colors used in brushing;
see the later section on resources.) </blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.glyphs</b> <blockquote><p>
Brushing glyphs: a
glyph type for each point in the plot, representing a row or case of the
data. The file should contain one glyph type per line. The glyph types are
as follows: <blockquote><p>
<br>
<pre>1 through 5: Five sizes of &rsquo;+&rsquo;
6 through 10: Five sizes of &rsquo;X&rsquo;
11 through 15: Five sizes of open rectangle
16 through 20: Five sizes of filled rectangle
21 through 25: Five sizes of open circle
26 through 30: Five sizes of filled circle
31: A single-pixel point
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.erase</b> <blockquote><p>
Erase: a column of 1s (to have a point erased on startup)
and 0s (to have the point plotted).  There should be one value per line
and as many lines as there are rows in the data. </blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.lines</b> <blockquote><p>
Line segments:
specifications for the pattern of line segments which connect pairs of
points. The file should contain two numbers per line.  The pair of numbers
represents the row numbers of the two points that should be connected. </blockquote>

<p>
<b>filename.linecolors</b> <blockquote><p>
Line colors: a color for each line in the .lines file.
The file should contain one color per line.  (It is best if the colors correspond
to the colors used in brushing; see the later section on resources.) </blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.nlinkable</b>
<blockquote><p>
The number of rows to be linked for brushing and identification.  By default,
nlinkable is equal to the number of rows in the data.  This feature can
be used to link ordinary scatterplots with plots that have some decorations
requiring additional points, such as clustering trees. </blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.vgroups</b>
<blockquote><p>
Variable groups: an integer for each column in the data. each set of columns
that is represented by the same integer  will grouped together for scaling
and transformation. The file is just one long line of integers. For example,
an input file with four columns could have a  and third columns are then
grouped.  The range of their plotting axes is be the same, and if column
2 is transformed, column 3 is transformed at the same time. </blockquote>
 <p>
<b>filename.resources</b>
<blockquote><p>
Resources: a set of datafile-specific XGobi resources, which specify the
size of the plotting window and some user-selection option settings. The
file is in the format of a standard X resource file. It can be directly
edited so that other resources can be specified. See the later section on
resource files for more information. </blockquote>
 <p>
All of the above files can be created
outside of XGobi, using an editor or other UNIX utilities, and several
of them (glyphs and colors, line segments and line color, resources) can
be stored during an XGobi session, in which case they represent the results
of interactions performed during that session. 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>X11 Resource Files</a></h2>
X11 resource
files are used to control size, color, layout, labels, and various other
windowing features.  The XGobi resources you are most likely to find useful
set the sizes of the plotting window and the variable selection panel,
the colors available for brushing, the font types and sizes, and the title
appearing in the title bar of the X window.  Some examples follow: <p>
In this
example, the first 5 of the 10 brushing colors are specified.  These colors
should be drawn from the set of colors available on your workstation or
X terminal, which you can probably determine using the X command &rsquo;showrgb.&rsquo;
<blockquote><br>
<pre>*brushColor0: white
*brushColor1: red
*brushColor2: green
*brushColor3: skyblue
*brushColor4: yellow
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here, the sizes of the plotting window and variable selection panel are
set.  All units are in pixels. This file was created interactively during
an XGobi session. <blockquote><br>
<pre>*XGobi*PlotWindow.height: 120
*XGobi*PlotWindow.width: 490
*XGobi*VarPanel.width: 390
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here, the title and font have been adjusted for making a videotape.  An
explanatory title and a large font are used. <blockquote><br>
<pre>*XGobi.title:    XGobi: Experimental Laser Data
*XGobi.iconName: XGobi: Laser
*plotFont: -*-lucida-medium-r-normal-sans-20-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Several logical variables controlling XGobi&rsquo;s behavior can be defined in
a resource file.  These are also represented by buttons, most of which are
found on the Option menu accessed from the main panel.  Descriptions can
be found in the help window for each button and in the full-length user&rsquo;s
manual. <blockquote><br>
<pre>*showAxes: True
*showPoints: True
*showLines: True
*linkBrush: True
*linkLineBrush: True
*linkIdentify: True
*linkTour: True
*plotSquare: True
*jumpBrush: True
*reshapeBrush: True
*carryVars: True
*glyphType: 6
*glyphSize: 1
*defaultPrintCmd: lpr -Pps1
</pre></blockquote>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>Tr2latex</b>
converts a document typeset in <b>troff</b> to a <b>LaTeX</b> format. It is intended to
do the first pass of the conversion. The user should then finish up the
rest of the conversion and customize the converted manuscript to his/her
liking. It can also serve as a tutor for those who want to convert from
troff to LaTeX. <p>
Most of the converted document will be in LaTeX but some
of it may be in plain <b>TeX.</b> It will also use some macros in <b>troffms.sty</b> or
<b>troffman.sty</b> which are included in the package and must be available to
the document when processed with LaTeX. <p>
If there is more than one input
file, they will all be converted into one LaTeX document. <p>
<b>Tr2latex</b> understands
most of the <b>-ms</b> and <b>-man</b> macros and <b>eqn</b> preprocessor symbols. It also understands
several plain <b>troff</b> commands. Few <b>tbl</b> preprocessor commands are understood
to help convert very simple tables. <p>
When converting manuals, use the <b>-m</b> flag.
Otherwise <b>tr2latex</b> assumes to translate a <b>-me</b> input file. <p>
If a troff command
cannot be converted, the line that contain that command will be commented
out. <p>
NOTE: if you have <b>eqn</b> symbols, you must have the in-line mathematics
delimiter defined by <b>delim</b> in the file you are converting. If it is defined
in another setup file, that setup file has to be concatenated with the
file to be converted, otherwise <b>tr2latex</b> will regard the in-line math as
ordinary text. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>-m</b> </dt>
<dd>Convert manual pages. This makes <b>tr2latex</b> understand
most of the <b>-man</b> macros. It uses the style file <b>troffman.sty</b><i>.</i> </dd>

<dt><b>-t</b> </dt>
<dd>Produce twoside
page style. </dd>

<dt><b>-<i>n</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Use a font size of <i>n</i>pt. The default font size is 12pt for <b>-man</b>
and 11pt otherwise. </dd>

<dt><b>-s <i>style</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Use the style file <i>style</i> instead of the default
<b>article.sty</b>. </dd>

<dt><b>-o <i>outfile</i></b> </dt>
<dd>Write output to file <i>outfile</i>. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Bugs</a></h2>
Many of these bugs
are harmless. Most of them cause local errors that can be fixed in the converted
manuscript. <p>
- Some macros and macro arguments are not recognized. <p>
- Commands
that are not separated from their argument by a space are not properly
parsed (e.g .sp3i). <p>
- When some operators (notably over, sub and sup) are renamed
(via define), then they are encountered in the text, <b>tr2latex</b> will treat
them as ordinary macros and will not apply their rules. <p>
- rpile, lpile and
cpile are treated the same as cpile. <p>
- rcol, lcol are treated the same as
ccol. <p>
- Math-mode size, gsize, fat, and gfont are ignored. <p>
- lineup and mark
are ignored. The rules are so different. <p>
- Some troff commands are translated
to commands that require delimiters that have to be explicitly put. Since
they are sometimes not put in troff, they can create problems. Example:
.nf not closed by .fi. <p>
- When local motions are converted to \raise or \lower,
an \hbox is needed, which has to be put manually after the conversion. <p>
- &rsquo;a
sub i sub j&rsquo; is converted to &rsquo;a_i_j&rsquo; which TeX parses as &rsquo;a_i{}_j}&rsquo; with a complaint
that it is vague. &rsquo;a sub {i sub j}&rsquo; is parsed correctly and converted to &rsquo;a_{i_j}&rsquo;.
<p>
- Line spacing is not changed within a paragraph in TeX (which is a bad
practice anyway). TeX uses the last line spacing in effect in that paragraph.

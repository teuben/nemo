<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>

<p> <i>conv123</i> is a utility for reading
a specially-formatted flat ASCII file and converting it into a Lotus/123(TM)
".wk1" file. Each specially-formatted ASCII file creates one entire spreadsheet.
This spreadsheet file is in its final, directly-readable  binary form, and
need undergo no further translation before being read directly by Lotus/123(TM).
 This feature makes <i>conv123</i> especially suited to networked environments,
where report writers or programs running on transaction processing machines
can easily and directly create spreadsheet output, instantly ready for
copying, downloading, or direct access in the MS-DOS(TM) or Macintosh(TM)
environments. In addition to individual data values, certain common aggregate
functions (formulas) may be specified (sum,min,max,variance,std deviation,
and average), and five binary functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and percentage) may also be specified. 
<p> The input file format
has been optimized for generation by a simple top-down, left-to-right report
generator, and is human-readable.  The input logic has been made fairly intelligent,
automatically discerning numeric and non-numeric values, calculating formula
ranges, and calculating the maximum number of decimal places in a row or
column. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>
There are currently no command-line options for <i>conv123.</i> 
<p>

<p> 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Parameters</a></h2>
The only parameters are the input and output file names, both
of which are optional; <i>conv123</i> can act as a filter, and by default accepts
its input from stdin and sends its output to stdout. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Input File Format</a></h2>
The
major feature of the input file format is a "definition" line, consisting
of all dashes (-) and spaces.  Each string of contiguous dashes on the "definition"
line will become a column in Lotus/123(TM), the width of that column being
determined by the number of dashes.  Characters in the input file that fall
outside these "column definitions" are ignored.  In addition, up to two
lines above the "definition" line can be used for header information, though
this is not required.  There may not be any white space before the first
dash on the definition line; in other words, the definition line MUST begin
in the first column of the input file. 
<p> Following is an example input file,
followed by a more detailed explanation of its contents: 
<p>             
      Jan          Feb         Mar         Qtr<br>
      Product      Sales        Sales       Sales       Total<br>
     ---------  -----------  ----------- ----------- -----------<br>
     widget-1     45000.87       54390.9    75947.12     @RSUM<br>
     widget-2     47000.78       64550.0    73647.77     @RSUM<br>
     widget-3     47800.11       67830.5    54536.37     @RSUM<br>
     widget-4     33003.30       76530.7    98653.83     @RSUM<br>
     widget-5     12000.44       64836.7    27637.91     @RSUM<br>
 
<p>                      @CSUM        @CSUM       @CSUM     @CSUM<br>
 
<p> This is a fairly simple spreadsheet with ten rows and five columns.  The
fifth column is actually made of formulas ("row sums"), as is the last
row ("column sums"). <i>conv123</i> is smart enough to know that each data value
in the first column is non-numeric, and creates the formulas in the fifth
column accordingly, i.e., the "row sums" are sums of the values in the second
through the fourth columns.  In addition, since <i>conv123</i> keeps track of the
maximum number of decimal places used in a given row or column, the number
of decimal places displayed in Lotus/123(TM) will be <a href='two.2.html'>two (2)</a>
 for all formulas,
with the exception of the CSUM in the third column, which will display
with <a href='one.1.html'>one (1)</a>
 decimal place.  Note also that the position of the number or
formula code in each column is not significant, as long as the entire values
fits under the dashed-line column definition(s).  Also, most spreadsheet
programs will re-position the values within each cell as the values are
displayed. 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Formula Codes</a></h2>
As has been shown in the above example, cell contents
may be decimal numbers or character values, with the width of the cell
determined by the width of the contiguous dashes in the "definition" line.
 Cell contents may also be formula codes.  A formula code is a contiguous
set of characters, always beginning with a commercial "at" sign (@).  There
are three types: row, column and both.  The type indicator is a single upper
case letter, one of "R" (row), "C" (column) or "B" (both), immediately
following the "@" ("at" sign). The formula function immediately follows
the type indicator, and may be an aggregate function or a binary function.
 The range for an aggregate function is calculated automatically, being
the range from the earliest available cell -- i.e., the cell farthest "above"
for columns, or farthest to the "left" for rows -- to the cell immediately
adjacent to the formula definition.  Note that this "farthest" cell location
is re-adjusted when a non-numeric cell definition is  encountered, being
set to begin at the next numeric cell (this does not include non-cells,
i.e., positions within the spreadsheet with no value).  The automatic range
start position may be overridden for "row" functions by placing a numeric
value at the end of the formula code (still contiguous).  A numeric value
at the end of a formula code is treated as an absolute column number, with
the first column defined as column <a href='one.1.html'>one (1)</a>
. 
<p> The range for a binary function
is simply the last two adjacent cells "above" the formula definition for
column functions, and "left" of the formula definition for row functions.
 The adjacent cell is always used in the calculation; an override number
after the function code in a row function is treated as an absolute column
number overriding the penultimate cell.  For commutative functions (addition
and multiplication), order is not significant. For non-commutative functions
(subtraction and division), the definition is a - b, or a/b, where a is
the penultimate cell, and b is the immediately adjacent cell.  If there
is an override column number, THIS ORDER IS REVERSED -- i.e., b - a and b/a,
where a is the overriding column number and b is the immediately adjacent
cell. This situation is made clearer in the examples below. 
<p> Following is
a summary of the available functions, which MUST be in upper case where
applicable: 
<p>     SUM -- Performs addition on a range of cells.<br>
     AVG -- Takes the average value on a range of cells.<br>
     MIN -- Extracts the minimum value on a range of cells.<br>
     MAX -- Extracts the minimum value on a range of cells.<br>
     VAR -- Calculates the variance on a range of cells.<br>
     STD -- Calculates the standard deviation on a range of cells.<br>
      +  -- Adds two cells.<br>
      -  -- Subtracts two cells.<br>
      *  -- Multiplies two cells.<br>
      /  -- Divides two cells.<br>
      %  -- Divides two cells, and multiplies the result by 100.<br>
     NUL -- This is actually not a function, but performs the task<br>
            of a "placeholder", preventing the "resetting" of auto-<br>
            matically calculated numeric ranges without creating<br>
            cell contents.  This function is most frequently used to<br>
            extend the row range of aggregate column functions.<br>

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Special Considerations</a></h2>

<p> The dashed-line definitions must begin at the
first character of the line in which they occur. 
<p> Output files are basically
in Lotus(TM) ".WK1" format, and output files should be named with this extension
to provide maximum information to spreadsheet programs. 
<p> Binary functions
in column formula codes are allowed, but rarely make much sense. 
<p> The program
is simple by design, and makes no attempt to incorporate useful, more complex
features such as absolute cell positioning, general-purpose formulae, macros,
etc.  It also has not undergone a complete test suite. 
<p> 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect9' href='#toc9'>Bugs</a></h2>

<p> The maximum
number of columns is currently hard-coded into the  program at 124; memory
should be dynamically allocated to support an arbitrary spreadsheet size.

<p> Optimizations could be applied at several points. 
<p> Starting/ending points
for formulae should be arbitrarily specifiable. <p>

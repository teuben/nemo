<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
mcstrip, cyclo - tools for analysing cyclomatic complexity 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>mcstrip</b>
[-l] [-c] [-r] [-a] [inputfile] <br>
<b>cyclo </b> [-l] [-t] [-f|-F] [-n func#] [-p] [-s scale] [-c]  [-d] [-i]  <br>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
These two tools are used to measure the cyclomatic complexity
of a piece of ANSI C or C++ code.  A postscript flowgraph of the  functions
can also be produced. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Commands</a></h2>
<b>mcstrip</b> <br>
This command removes comments, string and character constants from the
input file, or standard input if none is specified.  If any of  the following
options are given, it will give details of the file instead. <br>

<p>  [-l] print number of lines in file <br>
[-c] print number of lines that contain comments <br>
[-r] print ratio of lines against lines with comments <br>
[-a] print all of the above <br>
 
<p> <b>cyclo</b> <br>
This command takes as its standard input a file that has had the comments,
string and character constants removed (by <i>mcstrip</i> ).  It will then produce
either flowcharts or the cyclomatic complexity number of one or more files
in the input. <br>

<p> Information  [-l] prints results of tokenisation <br>
[-t] prints results of flow generation <br>
 Functions  [-i] ignores functions declared within a <br>
 struct/class/union  <br>
[-n func#] limits output of -p,-f,-F,-c to the given <br>
 function number, rather than the default of all functions.  <br>
[-f] prints function name(s) <br>
[-F] prints functions called by each source function <br>
[-c] print cyclomatic complexity of function(s) <br>
[-p] produce postscript flow graph <br>
[-s scale] scales postscript output (float) <br>
[-d] prints function names to postscript standard  output  <br>
 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Return Codes</a></h2>
<b>mcstrip</b> always returns zero. <b>cyclo</b> returns one in the event
of an error, otherwise it returns zero. 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Examples</a></h2>

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>More Detailed Information</a></h2>
The cyclomatic complexity measure counts the number
of decisions made within a piece of code.  This number is equal to the number
of linearly independent paths through the code.  Its main application is
in establishing test cases. Be aware that the measure may not be useful.
 It is recommended that further  reading is done before using it.

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Limitations</a></h2>
Only the ANSI C method of declaring
functions is recognised. <br>

<p> Constructors that have an initialiser list have their names incorrectly
detected. <br>

<p> Lexical elements that span more than one line are not recognised.  This
includes strings terminating with a continuation slash, struct and the
following tag, and function names and the following opening parenthesis.

usage205 - a very short and simple instruction list for Cyber 205 users.

<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Description</a></h2>
<b>(1)</b> Get yourself a password on one of the VAXes connected with
the JVNC. Your source code, input and output files will all be on one of
the many disks on these VAXes. A special set of programs has been developed,
by the JVNC staff (?), to submit batch files to the CYBER 205 which will
 compile and run programs, transfer files, look at the status of a job,
etc. These programs are called the PEP programs: their names all start with
PEP. Like PEPGET, PEPPUT, PEPTIME, PEPSTATUS, PEPCL, PEPGO etc. Use HELP
PEP on the VAX to get more up-to-date information. <p>
<p>
<b>(2)</b> Transfer your files
over to the VAX to a special directory (prefarably not your root directory).
Copy my LOGIN.COM file to give you a few extra UNIX commands, like MKDIR,
RMDIR and CD. Usually FTP will be used to transfer files from your host
to the JVNC VAX. Otherwise more elaborate programs like KERMIT or XMODEM
are also available. <p>
<p>
<b>(3)</b> Initialize IN EVERY NEW DIRECTORY you&rsquo;re going to
work with the CYBER 205 the PEP procedures by issuing <b>PEP</b> and follow it&rsquo;s
instructions. This is because PEP must make some INI file for you in that
directory. <p>
<p>
<b>(4)</b> Compile the source (<b>PEPCL</b>), put the datafiles on the 205
 (<b>PEPPUT</b>) and run your program (<b>PEPGO</b>). A simple fortran program TEST.FOR
will generate a series of VMS command procedures for compilation (TESTCL.COM
generated by PEPCL) and running (TESTGO.COM generated by PEPGO).  Of course
you, the user, can edit these files later for a more flexible usage of
the VAX-Cyber interaction. Type <b>HELP PEP COMMANDS</b> for a complete list of
PEP procedures.

<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Bugs</a></h2>
JVNC went
out of business in 1990. Manual page kept for historical reasons. <p>
I had problems
with emacs, but since I&rsquo;ve always been a MicroEmacs user, my portable version
(MEM) works fine for me. If however, you are going to use the real (supported)
version of Emacs, be aware that the operating system (like on most VMS
systems) intercepts the ^S-^Q as XON-XOFF, which means e.g. that you can&rsquo;t (forward)
find a string. Even worse, you can&rsquo;t save a file, since this is ^X^S in emacs.
(In MEM it is ESC-Z)  I have been able to live with this by using ^R, backwards
finding a string, in MEM. The JVNC staff gave me a file with rebindings
for EMACS to redefine some of the VMS intercepted control characters. <p>
<br>
<pre>Another solution is to set on every VMS link you use:
        SET TERM/NOTTSYNC (^S ^Q problem)
        SET TERM/PAST     (^C problem with some connections)

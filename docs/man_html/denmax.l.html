<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Options</a></h2>
<b>-e &lt;fEpsilon&gt;:</b>
No Default fEpsilon value! <br>
This parameter should be set to the length scale of interest for the groups.
For example in a  gas simulation it might be set to the rough size of galaxies.
This parameter also sets the resolution limit of the simulation and thus
the resolution of the density gradients used for sliding the particles.
For more information of this parameter&rsquo;s signifigance  see the discussion
below. 
<p> <b>[-s &lt;nSmooth&gt;]:</b> Default nSmooth = 64 <br>
Specifies the number of neighbors to smooth over when finding  densities.

<p> <b>[-d &lt;fMinDensity&gt;]:</b> Default fMinDensity = 0.0 <br>
This sets the minimum density for dark matter or gas particles which are
considered for grouping. 
<p> <b>[-t &lt;fMaxTemperature&gt;]:</b> Default fMaxTemperature =
HUGE <br>
This sets the maximum temperature for gas  particles which are considered
for grouping. 
<p> <b>[-z &lt;fRedShift&gt;]:</b> Default fRedShift = 0.0 <br>
The redshift of the input file. This is used to determine physical coordinates
from comoving ones. The default of 0.0 specifies that the input file is the
state of the simulation at our (the current) epoch. 
<p> <b>[-G &lt;fGravConst&gt;]:</b> Default
fGravConst = 1.0 <br>
The relevant gravitational constant in the units of the simulation. Most
N-body simulations have their units set such that this constant is 1.0. 
<p> <b>[-O
&lt;fOmega&gt;]:</b> Default fOmega = 1.0 <br>
This sets the Omega parameter for the simulation in question. The default
value of 1.0 specifies a flat universe. 
<p> <b>[-H &lt;fHubble&gt;]:</b> Default fHubble = 0.0
<br>
Sets the Hubble constant for the simulation. If the simulation was not performed
in comoving coordinates then this can be left at zero. Note that this must
be set in the units of the simulation. 
<p> <b>[-m &lt;nMinMembers&gt;]:</b> Default nMinMembers
= 4 <br>
This argument allows the user to specify what the minimum number of members
(particles) per group should be. All groups  with less than this value will
be dicarded. 
<p> <b>[-px &lt;xPeriod&gt;]:</b> Default non-periodic in x dimension <br>
Specifies that denmax take into account periodicity in the x-dimension given
by the period &lt;xPeriod&gt;. 
<p> <b>[-py &lt;yPeriod&gt;] [-pz &lt;zPeriod&gt;]:</b> As above. 
<p> <b>[-p &lt;xyzPeriod&gt;]:</b>
Default non-periodic in x,y and z dimensions <br>
Specifies that denmax take into account periodicity in all three dimension
given by the period &lt;xyzPeriod&gt;. This can be used in place of the above as
a shorthand. 
<p> <b>[-cx &lt;xCenter&gt;]:</b> Default box center is 0.0 in x dimension <br>
Specifies the center of the periodic box when denmax takes into account
periodicity in the x-dimension. This arguement can be ignored for a non-periodic
simulation. 
<p> <b>[-cy &lt;yCenter&gt;] [-cz &lt;zCenter&gt;]:</b> As above for y and z dimensions.

<p> <b>[-c &lt;xyzCenter&gt;]:</b> Default box center is 0.0 in x,y and z dimensions <br>
For periodic simulations specifies the center of the box in all three dimensions.
This is a shorthand to the above. 
<p> <b>[-r]:</b> Causes the denmax.ray output file
to be produced. <br>
By default denmax does not produce the denmax.ray output file. With this
argument present it will produce this (tipsy vector format) file. 
<p> <b>[-nu]:</b>
Disables Unbinding (No Unbinding). <br>
When this flag is specified denmax will bypass the unbinding procedure
but still output all the normal group information. This is  useful if special
unbinding methods are required for a simulation or if unbinding is completely
undesired. The user can write a special unbinding program which would read
the denmax.grp file. 
<p> <b>[-o &lt;Output Name&gt;]:</b> Default Output Name = "denmax". <br>
This allows the user to specify an alternate name for the  output files.
For example, if the user specifies -o sim5 on the command line, then denmax
will by default produce the files sim5.grp and sim5.gtp (and if requested
sim5.ray). 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>

<p> Denmax finds gravitationally bound groups in N-body
simulations. The  general procedure is first to decide which particles should
be grouped, these are called the "moving" particles. The particles considered
may be of a certain type (there are three types in the tipsy format, dark
matter, gas and stars). They may have to  satisfy a minimum density criterion
and may also (in the case of gas)  need to satisfy a maximum temperature
criterion. This choice of particles is affected by the type of input file
and the users settings for the  minimum density and maximum temperature.
There are seven possible types of tipsy input files and here is how each
is handled. 
<p> <b>Dark matter only:</b> density and density gradients are calculated
from all the particles (dark), and the moving particles are those meeting
the minimum density criterion. 
<p> <b>Gas only:</b> density and density gradients
are calculated from all the  particles (gas), and the moving particles
are those meeting both the  minimum density and maximum temperature criteria.

<p> <b>Stars only:</b> density gradients are calculated from all the particles (stars),
and all the particles are moved. 
<p> <b>Gas and dark matter:</b> density and density
gradients are calculated from the gas particles only, and the moving particles
are the gas particles  which meet the density and temperature criteria.

<p> <b>Stars and gas:</b> density gradients are calculated from the  star particles
only, and the moving particles are all the star particles. 
<p> <b>Stars and dark
matter:</b> Same as stars and gas case. 
<p> <b>Stars and gas and dark matter:</b> density
and density gradients are calculated from all the star particles and all
the gas particles. The moving particles are then the gas particles meeting
the density and temperature criteria and all the star particles. 
<p> Once the
moving particles have been found they are then moved along the initial
density gradients toward regions of higher density. The particles are successively
stepped a distance of fEpsilon/4.0 in this manner until they stay within
a distance of fEpsilon over 5 steps. This mean that they are oscillating
in a local high density region. We then group all the particles in each
high density region together using the friends-of-friends method with a linking
length of fEpsilon. Note that this also links together high density regions
seperated by  less than fEpsilon. Once all particles are localized in this
way, we proceed to "squish" them together even more to find the high density
center. Lastly we discard groups with less than nMinMembers number of  particles.

<p> The next stage (if the user has not specified -nu) is to remove particles
from a group which are not gravitationally bound  to it. We call this phase
unbinding and the initial positions are considered here, not the moved
positions. There are cases for  unbinding, one for dark matter only or star
particle only inputs (case I unbinding) and one for the other input types
(case II  unbinding). 
<p> <b>Case I unbinding:</b> 
<p> 1. Calculate the potential energies
of all the particles in the  group taking into account the redshift of
the simulation to get physical distances (redshift zero applies also to
a simulation in physical coordinates). 
<p> 2. The center of mass and center
of mass velocity for the group is found. The velocity relative to the center
of mass velocity  if found for all the particles in the group. This relative
velocity is converted to a physical velocity by taking into account the
 redshift and adding a term to include the Hubble flow. For a  simulation
in physical coordinates fHubble must be 0.0. (Note that this is the default!)
From this the kinetic energy with respect to the center of mass is found
for all particles in the  group. 
<p> 3. The least bound particle is found. If
this particle is bound then all particles are bound and we have finished
unbinding for this group. Otherwise we must remove it from the group, adjusting
the  potential energies and kinetic energies (the center of mass changes)
of the remaining particles and return to step 3. 
<p> <b>Case II unbinding:</b> 
<p> Here
we include some of the group&rsquo;s environment to the potential. For example
a galaxy depends on its dark matter halo in order to  stay together. 
<p> 1.
Calculate the potential energies as per case I, step 1. 
<p> 1a. Include the
potential contribution of all non-grouped mass  within a 2*fEpsilon ball
about the center of the high density region of the group. In otherwords
we want to include some of the mass about the density maximum.  
<p> 2. Calculate
the kinetic energies as per case I, step 2. 
<p> 3. The least bound particle
is found. If this particle is bound then again we are finished with the
group. Otherwise we remove it from the group, adjusting the kinetic energies
as in case I. Then  we go back to step 3. Note that this time we do not subtract
the  potential energy contribution of this particle from the others in
the group. The potential energies remain fixed as any removed  particle
is still considered to be part of the groups environment. 
<p> After unbinding
we check once more that all groups have  at least nMinMembers number of
particles. We discard those that  don&rsquo;t and output the group information.

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Output Files</a></h2>

<p> Denmax produces three different output files, by default
a  denmax.grp file, and a denmax.gtp file. Optionally also a  denmax.ray file.

<p> <b>denmax.grp:</b> This ASCII file is in TIPSY ARRAY format  and contains the
group number to which each particle in  the input file belongs. Group number
zero means this  particle was not grouped (could have been removed by 
unbinding). This file can be read in by tipsy or any other analysis tool
able to read this format. 
<p> <b>denmax.gtp:</b> This file is in TIPSY BINARY format
(same as the input file) and contains one star particle to represent each
group that denmax finds. Each particle in this file has as its position,
the position of the  group&rsquo;s density maximum. As its velocity, the center
of  mass velocity of the group. Each star particle&rsquo;s mass is  the mass of
the entire group and the star_particle.eps field contains the radial size
of the group. (The time stamp of the input file is also stored in each 
star_particle.tform field.) This file can also be read in by tipsy or any
tool accepting TIPSY BINARY format. 
<p> <b>denmax.ray:</b> This ASCII file is in TIPSY
VECTOR format and contains a vector pointing from the initial position
of each particle to the localized (moved and squished)  position of that
particle. For particles not moved the vector stored is null. This file can
be read in by tipsy and used to analyse the actions of denmax. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Examples</a></h2>

<p>
&gt; denmax -e 9e-4 -H 2.8944 -d 170 -p 1 -o dark &lt; dark.bin 
<p> This example groups dark
matter particles in the file dark.bin. The simulation is periodic with period
length of 1.0 in each dimension and box centered on (0,0,0). The Hubble constant
in system units in this case is  2.8944 (sqrt(8*Pi/3)) and the redshift
defaults to  0 (current epoch). The density cut is made at a density  of
170 (mean density is 1 in these units). The files dark.grp and dark.gtp are
produced. 
<p> &gt; denmax -e 9e-4 -H 2.8944 -d 170 -t 30000 -z 1 -p 1 &lt; all.bin 
<p> Here we
suppose that dark matter, gas and stars are in  the input file. A cut in
the gas is made at a density minimum of 170 and temperature maximum of
30000  (cold dense gas) and groups of this gas and all the stars are formed
at a redshift of 1. The files denmax.grp and denmax.gtp are created. 
<p> &gt; denmax
-e 0.5 -d 100 -m 8 -r -nu -o phys &lt; phys.bin 
<p> Here denmax processes a dark matter
file in physical  coordinates which is non-periodic. It makes a density cut
at 100 and finds the groups, but does not try  to unbind any particles.
It does remove groups with less than 8 members. The output files phys.grp,
phys.gtp and phys.ray (-r) are produced.  
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Warnings</a></h2>

<p> 1. Make sure you set fEpsilon
to a reasonable size for your simulation. If too small it can take a long
time to converge and may not give reasonable groups do to the limited resolution
of objects in the simulation. If too large, it will miss the  smaller scale
objects and may group together many smaller objects to form large associations.
For example the desired groups could be galaxies in a gas and dark matter
simulation, epsilon should reflect this fact. 
<p> 2. Do not run denmax with
an nSmooth of less than 64 when  finding groups in a dark matter only input
file. For gas simulations an nSmooth of 32 is acceptable. 
<p> 3. The unbinding
procedure is O(Ngroup^2), this means that for very large simulations and
specifically situations where groups larger than a couple of thousand members
are found the unbinding procedure could be prohibitive. So far this has
not been a real problem, even in a 2.1 million particle simulation, however,
future versions of denmax may need to use a tree code for the  group pootential
energies. (The friends-of-friends is actually also O(Ngroup^2) but this is
not such a big problem)

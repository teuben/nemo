<H2> 4.3.1:  in github</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> (Feb 10, 2022) branch <B>table2</B> created to finish the table V2 implementation.
  <LI> (Feb 2022) Various tools for the (snapshot/orbit) BOOM project upgraded:
    snaptipsy, tipsysnap, snapcopy, stoo, orboom, orbstat.  Started an example in
    <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/blob/master/docs/examples/boom.md>boom.md</A>

  <LI> (Jan 20, 2022) Get some working exaples with gadget files and clarify current state of their versions. The man page
    <A HREF=man_html/gadget.5.html>gadget</A> will be updated for this.
  <LI> (Jan 8, 2022) Fixed WCS in
    <A HREF=man_html/potccd.1.html>potccd</A>, added new program
    <A HREF=man_html/ccdl2.1.html>ccdl2</A> to find Lagrange points in a 2D grid potential.
</UL>
  
<A NAME=4_3_0>
<H2> 4.3.0:  7-jan-2022 </H2>
<UL>
  <LI> (Jan 6, 2022)  Merged the nearly complete M1 branch to master; some merging with other old code for new release
  <LI> (Dec 30, 2021) New parameter grabbing program (shortcut for grep/awk...)
    <A HREF=man_html/txtpar.1.html>txtpar</A> and big update/bugfix for
    <A HREF=man_html/tabdms.1.html>tabdms</A> 
  <LI> The default anaconda3 install is now 2021.05
  <LI> (Oct, 2023)  <A HREF=https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/>gnuastro</A>
       is now installable via mknemo (courtesy ADASS meeting) - trying out a demo program <B>fitsgnu</B>
  <LI> (July 12-15 2021) This week is the AMUSE workshop. So a few NEMO-ish highlights:
    <UL>
      <LI> <A HREF=https://github.com/GalacticDynamics-Oxford/pyfalcon>Python interface for the fast-multipole gravity solver falcON </A>
      <LI> <A HREF=https://clustertools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/initialize.html#load>ClusterTools</A> reads gyrfalcon (NEMO) data 
    </UL>
      
  <LI> Images now read the Object name, coming from FITS, and pass it on. Like the proper
    handling of the WCS axis=1 mode, not all programs have been converted.
  <LI> (22-may-2021) New stacking style program:
    <A HREF=man_html/ccdstack.1.html>ccdstack</A>     
  <LI> (6-may-2021) New stacking style program:
    <A HREF=man_html/rvstack.1.html>rvstack</A> 
  <LI> (2-may-2021)  Result on an M1 compilation showed 4/6 codes with an impressive
    <A HREF=man_html/bench.5.html>NEMOBENCH5 score</A> of
    1310, but also showed the default compiler (hpc.sourceforge.net) was much more strict C99
    and failed many programs. Work to do, and its taking place in the M1 git branch. The final score
    when all 6 codes were working was 1269.
  <LI> (29-apr-2021) One more code added to the 5sec bench, now called "make bench5" (from bench3) -
    the NEMO5 score will be defined as 5000/average_runtime, such that a score of 1000 is the
    first benchmark machine I used (i5-1135G7)
  <LI> (27-apr-2021) We started to convert the old NEMO manual from latex to reStructuredText (RST)
    so changes are immediately visible on <A HREF=https://astronemo.readthedocs.io/>ReadTheDocs</A>.
  <LI> (20-apr-2021) Added new historic program
    <A HREF=man_html/epic5.1.html>epic5</A> to compute Lindblad orbits in an oval potential.
    The original idea is outlined in
    <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ASPC...66...29L> 1994ASPC...66...29L</A>
    and the final code presented in
    <A HREF=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.421.1089P> 2012MNRAS.421.1089P </A>.

  <LI> (19-apr-2021) Added new historic program
    <A HREF=man_html/mkvh60.1.html>mkvh60</A> and added von Hoerner's 1957 (!) random number generator to create this style
    of homogeneous spheres. See <A HREF=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1960ZA.....50..184V>1960ZA.....50..184V</A>

  <LI> (15-apr-2021) Trying out a new automated <A HREF=man_html/bibcode.html>bibcode</A> listing which summarized and links
    all codes in NEMO that have refereed papers on <A HREF=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/>ADS</A>
    (as opposed to <A HREF=https://paperswithcode.com>Papers with Code</A>)

<LI> (7-apr-2021) Apple's long SIP arm reared it's ugly head again, a side effect of the MAC fix caused
    falcon's bodyfun to fail on linux. should be fixed now.
  <LI> Benchfile introduced, with a function similar to the Testfile, all parallel to the Makefile
  <LI> The "make bench5" command will now run 5 nbody codes, each tuned to take 5sec cpu on an i5-1135G7

<A NAME=4_2_1>
<H2> 4.2.1:  12-feb-2021</H2>
<UL>
  <LI> (12-feb-2021) wrapped up the MAC SIP issues (or so I thought)
  <LI> (11-feb-2021) added new program 
        <A HREF=man_html/ccdspec.1.html>ccdspec</A> 
    with a simple correlation statistic to assess normalcy
  <LI> (8-feb-2021) back to previous default: shared libs remains enabled by default, so on a mac you will need to use
    --disable-shared now.
  <LI> (6-feb-2021) major issue on recent Mac:  latest (clang 11.0.0)) Xcode does not compile gyrfalcON anymore,
    but brew based gcc-10 (10.2.0) works. More importantly, the SIP implementation causes shared libraries to not work
    in scripts, or any system that will then filter out $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.   Thus the default is now that
    shared libraries will not be made. Use --enable-shared if you want it back (e.g. on linux). Note that the NEMO
    library has not worked in shared library mode for a while.
</UL>

<A NAME=4_2_0>
<H2> 4.2.0:  28-jan-2021 (a.k.a. the Corona release) </H2>

Although there is still a raging virus, it's just time to wrap this up this release
given the large number of updates.
<UL>

  <LI> (jan-2021) CCD images should now all be using a reference pixel, where in the
    old code (0,0,0) was hardcoded and Axis=0. Images should now have Axis=1, otherwise
    code was not converted yet.
  <LI> (jan-2021) new programs:  ccdmoms, ccdellint, lmtinfo, ccdzshift
  <LI> Code made C99 clean, mostly.
  <LI> (oct-2020) new programs:  tabgen, snapnear, bigread, snapipdist
    new script;  mk_cone, mklut
  <LI> (30-may-2020)  the command <B>mknemo barolo</B> attempts to install the
    <A HREF=https://editeodoro.github.io/Bbarolo/>BBarolo</A> program for rotation curve analysis of 3D cubes.
Another useful tool to automated parameter editing is
<A HREF=man_html/pedit.8.html>pedit</A>. An example is in a new script
<A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/blob/master/scripts/csh/do_neeleman>do_neeleman</A>

<Li> (16-may-2020)  new program <A HREF=man_html/mktabdisk.1.html>mktabdisk</A> to make fake disks to
  simulate observe PPV cubes

  <LI> (11-may-2020) benchmark streamlined:

although this is on my T480 Lenovo laptop (i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz) I have yet to see any desktop being
to beat this.
  <LI> (26-apr-2020) tabplot and tabhist have a new <b>pyplot=</b> keyword to write a template starting point for matplotlib plotting
  <LI> (24-apr-2020) Experimental <A HREF=https://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/nemo/deb/>debian packages for NEMO</A>
  <LI> (23-apr-2020) small fix for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  <LI> (10-apr-2020) the <A HREF=faq.html>FAQ</A> has been revived.
  <LI> (21-mar-2020) RSS feed re-instated. Now using https://teuben.github.io/nemo/rss.xml
  <LI> (13-mar-2020) fixed the  <B>mknemo uns_projects</B> install, which now
    installs both
    unsio and uns_projects.  After this the following command may be an amusing screensaver
    <pre>
      mkspiral - nbody=10000| gyrfalcON - - step=0 eps=0.05 kmax=6 logfile=/dev/null | uns_density - - all | glnemo2 - all play=t
      </pre>

  <LI> (14-feb-2020) resurrected an easier install of
     <A HREF=man_html/gadget.1.html>gadget2</A>
    via mknemo, added a galaxy benchmark
    
  <LI> <A HREF=man_html/snapmstat.1.html>snapmstat</A>
    now computes the <b>select=</b> string for
    <A HREF=man_html/glnemo2.1.html>glnemo2</A>    
    to help visualizing complex systems with many mass species 
  <LI> Moved more package install scripts into mknemo.d, where they can use the new tar
    caching (hdf4, hdf5, cfitsio, gsl, fftw, wcslib) scheme
  <LI> Some integration of NEMO's configure with the falcON makefile's (currently -fopenmp and -march=native are set this way)
  <LI>  
    install instructions updated; see $NEMO/usr/zeno
  <LI> A frontend to the
    <A HREF=http://lp-vicode.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/>LP-VIcode</A>, which computes a series of chaos indicators
for orbits, is available as
<A HREF=man_html/runlpvi.1.html>runlpvi</A>
  <LI> (29-dec-2019) Each NEMO program can now use openmp calls, but I continue to be frustrated how hard it is to speed things up.
  <LI> (26-dec-2019) Some overhaul of the autoconf based configure/make system. For HDF4, HDF5 and CFITSIO there are now direct install methods
    which install these packages under $NEMO/opt.
    This also bypasses a lot of the issues of non-standard installation paths
    that centos and ubuntu are often using. There is also a new "simpler"  <B>install_nemo.sh</B> script.
  <LI> (20-dec-2019) <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/blob/master/nemo_start_example.ipynb>jupyter notebook</A> support, as long as you
    find a way to copy the new <B>nemo_start.py</B> somewhere in your $PYTHONPATH.  More to come here.

<A NAME=4_1_0>
  <H2> 4.1.0:  10 December 2019 (a.k.a. the IAS release) </H2>

  Inspired by a visit to the IAS, including a presentation, this was released before the drive back to DC.
  
<UL>
  <LI> Added the <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/blob/master/src/orbit/potential/data/hh64.c>
    Henon Heiles 1964 potential</A>, another Princeton contribution to the field!
  <LI> Added optional (but now defaulted as such) writing Phi/Acc to orbits
  <LI> (dec-2019) simplified install with a travis C/C++ CI on github,
    results on <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo/actions>Github Actions</A>.
  <LI> (dec-2019) better support for BASH users, notably the falcON environment
  <LI> (nov-2019) New program <A HREF=man_html/bsf.1.html>bsf</A> to help with benchmark data regression.
  <LI> (nov-2019) New program <A HREF=man_html/sdinfo.1.html>sdinfo</A> to test SDFITS files
  <LI> (nov-2010) A new maintenance script "mktasklist" will maintain the "help=u" tasklist, possible for codemeta.json/CITATION.cff (nov)
  <LI> (nov-2019) The optional "make python" target can now install an anaconda3 private to NEMO.
    Use python_start.sh to add to your shell. Install this after NEMO has been installed. It will also install python tools used in
    stellar dynamics
  <LI> (oct-2019) Some support for EAGLE data with <A HREF=man_html/eaglesnap.1.html>eaglesnap</A>.
    Inspired by <A HREF=https://github.com/kyleaoman/martini>martini</A>.  There is an
    <A HREF=examples/eagle.html>example</A> showing this in action
  <LI> <A HREF=examples/sh76.html>Sanders and Huntley 1976 orbits added</A>
  <LI> galaxy V1.5 now supported 
  <LI> install script renamed from test_a_new_nemo_git to install_nemo
  <LI> (feb-2019) support for NBODY6 via runbody6
  <LI> (feb-2019) darwin (MacOSX) installation now defaults to the one using <A HREF=https://brew.sh>Homebrew</A>, though
    with "brew install pgplot" installed version, you can now also use "install_nemo brew=1"
</UL>

<A NAME=4_0_0>
  <H2> 4.0.0:  1 January 2018 (a.k.a. the ESO release) </H2>

  During my mini-sabattical at ESO found some time to switch from CVS to GIT.
  
<UL>
<LI> conversion of our source code based in CVS to GIT. Source on
  <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/nemo>  https://github.com/teuben/nemo</A>, docs now served via github pages on
  <A HREF=https://teuben.github.io/nemo>   https://teuben.github.io/nemo</A>.  The conversion process is
  when you see versions 3.9.x.
<LI> pgplot has been split into a separate git repo on
  <A HREF=https://github.com/teuben/pgplot>  https://github.com/teuben/pgplot</A>, though this code is shared with miriad. Since MIRIAD has not been converted
  to git yet, sans the fork at
<A HREF=https://github.com/pkgw/carma-miriad>carma-miriad</A>, this will need to be resolved. Apart from the dormant Caltech site, various Linux and Mac distros also make pgplot available, e.g. in Ubuntu "apt install pgplot5" works with
NEMO as well. Another PGPLOT re-implemention seems to be in the <A HREF=http://giza.sourceforge.net/>giza</A> package,
but not all pgplot functions are fully implemented yet.
  
<LI> The <A HREF=http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo> old NEMO website </A> should disappear.... but will likely
  remain available for a while.

<UL>
<LI> (14-mar-2014) lots of minor updates to man pages and a number of ccd image tools
<LI> (13-mar-2014) update glnemo2 to 1.6.1, it now compiles with qt5 (and qt4 still too)
<LI> (12-mar-2014) updated <A HREF=http://projets.lam.fr/projects/unsio/>UNSIO</A> to 1.0.0!!, this
also include python support (see $NEMO/py/modules after this has been installed)
<LI> (17-sep-2013) new <A HREF=man_html/runbulgerot.1.html>runbulgerot</A> program to compute rotation curves of Sersic bulges (Noordermeer,2008)
<LI> massive updates to glnemo2/unsio
<LI> (29-mar-2013) updated supper for <A HREF=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/s2plot/>
	s2plot</A>. No changes needed to 
 <A HREF=man_html/snaps2plot.1.html>snaps2plot</A> itself.
<LI> (10-mar-2013) added 3body.tab and a script mk_3body to run the orbits
from the <A HREF=http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0181>
Suvakov & Dmitrasinovic (2013)</A> paper.
<LI> (13-feb-2013) more consistent usage of voxel units and using moments and such that reporting total
emission from cubes and moment maps via snapgrid, ccdmom is consistent.
<LI> (24-jan-2013) clean up some macos 10.8 installation issues, now fully clean, though Ubuntu 12 now
needs the DSO linking fix (e.g. uncomment the NEMO_CFLAGS1 macro in $NEMOLIB/makedefs)

<LI> (17-jan-2013) branched MATDEF, to clarify CDEF and FORDEF with the goal to switch over to FORDEF
<LI> nothing new yet,  updates to rundiskfit expected.

This was the (modest 5c)
<A HREF=http://modesta.science.uva.nl/modest/modest5c/index.html>
nbody-school</A> release.

<UL>

<LI> (1-aug)  Resurrected
 <A HREF=man_html/dtos.1.html>dtos</A>. and

<LI> (2-jun) new routines <I>put_data_blocked</I> and <I>get_data_blocked</I>
	allowing blocked (sequential) I/O. These routines work much like
	their random counterparts, 
	 <I>put_data_ran</I> and <I>get_data_ran</I>
	except I/O must occur sequentially. No doubt some bugshaking will
	be needed.
<LI> (13-may) (new)  <A HREF=man_html/tabextinct.1.html>tabextinct</A>  and
 <A HREF=man_html/tabint.1.html>tabint</A>.

<LI> (28-mar) some additional fixes for cygwin, but still too far from an automated install.
	See <A HREF=man_html/bench.5.html>benchmarks</A> for some standard
	NEMO benchmarks. Basic conclusion: don't use cygwin for any serious
	work,particularly the I/O is nearly a factor of 10 worse, and 
	C++ code runs about 2-4 slower. C and Fortran much closer.
<LI> (25-mar) (new) <A HREF=man_html/snappot.1.html>snappot</A> computes potentials/forces from analytical potentials

	hdfgrid when dealing with rank=3 files.
<LI> (3-dec)  (new) <A HREF=man_html/glnemo.1.html>glnemo</A>, a Qt based 
  interactive visualization program (Lambert).

	using CVS updates, you have to manuallly copy it:
<PRE>
	cp $NEMO/inc/max/maxsizes.h $NEMOLIB 
</PRE>
	else the installation will automagically take care of this.
<LI> (19-aug) perorb : fixed allocation and added new  last= keyword
<LI> (29-jul) cfitsio.install and test_a_new_nemo_cvs now simplify using CFITSIO
<LI> (15-jul) acceleration: a new more general version of potential (Walter Dehnen)

<LI> (12-apr) User and Programmers guide: slowly etching away more old lies
<LI> (12-apr) activated a new toplevel 'make bins', which should make as many programs
as are possible (depending on correct settings of your makedefs file).
Good excersize of your CPU and HD. Instead of the usual 100 or
so binaries with the testsuite method, this one gives you nearly 200! The manual page
tree contains 270 entries, so still some more additions to do.

 <A NAME=3_2_1>
<H2>3.2.1: 11 April 2004 (a.k.a. the Easter release) </H2>

<UL>
<LI> (11-apr) User and Programmers guide: first 4 chapters now updated. 
<LI> (11-apr) removed YAPPLIB from the environment into makedefs
<LI> (11-apr) yanc, the predecessor of falcON, has been removed from the tree and CVS.
<LI> (11-apr) A small patch is still needed for 
	<A HREF=macosx.html>MacOSX</A> 10.3 users, read item 3 at the
	bottom of this link (almost perfect)
<LI> (11-apr) CVS (or any other) updates should read <A HREF=nemo32.html>upgrade details</A>
<LI> (11-apr) merged from the branch <B>NemoHost3</B> the following
changes are made in the build system, as well as a few fixes.
<UL>
<LI>A change in the directory structure in the sense that $NEMOHOST
subdirectories in $NEMO/{bin,lib,obj} are now no longer supported;
instead files are directly placed in the {bin,lib,obj}
directories. The environment 
variables $NEMOBIN, $NEMOLIB, $NEMOOBJ are accordingly modified, 
otherwise it has very little impact on a running system. The
$NEMO/host tree has disappeared, and is replaced with the $NEMO/opt tree.
<LI>  added more programs to the testsuite
<LI>  fixed two bugs in bodytrans: when more than one new bodytrans 
	function was given in the same program, and fixed bodytrans
	usage in pipes again.
	 (bodytrans is now  also removing the /tmp/bt* files)
<LI>  fixed PGPLOT interface for multi-panel programs (this may not work
	well if PGPLOT_FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND are used)
<LI>  MacOSX (10.3) support (as much as the filesystem
	with its filecasing problem supports)

 <A NAME=3_0_0>
<H2>3.0.0: (1 April 2001) </H2>
The new release series for NEMO V3 is imminent. Although the code is
compatible, some details in shared object loaded have now been changed,
and are not backwards compatible. You should probably not overlay the new
NEMO on top of an old directory structure (although nothing has
changed to that). CVS is now also offered to those who like to 
participate in the development.

</UL>

<A NAME=2_5_0>
<H2>2.5.0: 16 December 1999 </H2>

<UL>
<LI>
(16-dec) Major new release with many many small changes. The most important
change is probably usage of standard <B>configure</B> script as the
first stage during installation. Also, we are now 
(kind of) using CVS for source
code management. During the next few weeks I expect to have a few more
small updates that irons out installations on a variety of machines. 


<LI> (16-dec) merged all the never-released 2.4.5 updates, 
	and went straight to an official 2.5.0 release.
<LI> (12-jan) random snap I/O implemented with promising performance
	benchmarks.
<LI> (21-feb) all makefile's now use -O compile flags, as opposed to
	a debugged -g. On some archictures significant improvements
	can be achieved with tailored FLAGS, e.g. -fast on some Sparc's.
<LI> (11-feb) nbody0 had an emberassing array index bug, and although
	in a higher order term correction, will cause substantial
	errors on long integrations. Various minor improvements to
	installation, including automated pgplot installation.

<A NAME=2_4_4>
<H2>2.4.4: 28 January 1998 </H2>
<UL>
<LI> (28-jan) Long awaiting. Added tkrun, Aarseth's triple star integrator and 
  finalized this release. Fixed some export files for scfm. gamma functions
  for tablsqfit, version ID checking (nemo.version)
<LI> (25-jul) fits.c now checks for new ("Year-2000") style DATExxxx header
	items.
<LI> (7-jul) added <B>scfm</B>, the self consistent field method N-body
	integrator. Thanks to Lars Hernquist.
<LI> (1-jul) the next release (sometime later this month) 
	will be 2.5.0, not 2.4.5 because of a change
	in directory structure  on the "aarseth/nbody*" series. You can
	safely overlay the old tree, but be sure to delete
	aarseth/nbody2 before you do this.
<LI> (27-jun) new manpages (authors.5, ommod.5), working on king(1NEMO)
	and runbody2(1NEMO)

<A NAME=2_4_3>
<H2>2.4.3: 26 June 1997</H2>

	modifications. New: catpgps (to catenate PGPLOT ps files), runbody2
	(a frontend for nbody2), added Dehnen's potential, snapmass with IMF.
	<br>
	accidentally a core dump and two executables were added to yapp's
	source code directory.
<LI> (6-jun) Added Sellwood's 3D cartesian Nbody code. (src/nbody/sellwood/code1)
<LI> (1-jun) Fixed another typo in the initial conditions of the IAU 25 body problem.
The energy is now -0.2 within the expected margin of error. This should really
be the last fix to this benchmark dataset.

   portability problems.
   remaining (tabmath) problem on SGI's fixed, rvsnap and snaprv 
	completed. Number of man pages updated and upgraded.
<LI> Version 2.4.1 installed on a DecAlpha 500, running 
Digital UNIX V4.0B  (Rev. 564), the fastest
machine we have NEMO currently running on. The standard hackcode1 bench
runs in 0.0048 sec, twice the speed on the Onyx-2. Since we didn't have
a fortran compiler, yapp_gl with VOGL (GL emulator) was used (fixed few
minor bugs)

<H2>2.4.0: 1 April 1997</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Version 2.4.0 released, which is the one that comes after 2.3.8.
	It will contain two major changes, and a number of
	small changes and additions:
    <UL>
    <LI> code should now run in -DSINGLEPREC mode. Some problem areas remain,
         which are planned to be solved in upcoming patches:
        <UL>
        <LI> use of vectmath in potential's is not good, since potentials
            are hardcoded in double precision, and vectmath uses 'real' and 
            the precision flag.
        <LI> function pointers cannot always be generic proc's, they need to
		be typedef'd by function if the arguments are float's
		(some compilers may pass unspecified arguments as double)
        </UL>
    <LI> various directories now have a <em>Testfile</em>, which are gnu 
         compatible makefile's used to run a testsuite of
         programs through nemo. You can look at our most
         recent <A HREF=testsuite.log>testsuite.log</A> and compare
         with your version (if we have it online).
    <LI> fortran (src/kernel/fortran) support now compiled in the library 
         by default. Portability not really looked into.
    <LI> xyz programs (snapxyz, xyzview) for 3D viewing and movies formally
        added. You either need to compile the 
	<A HREF=optional.html>vogl library</A>, or on an SGI
        you can use the native GL library (much nicer and faster).
    </UL>
</UL>

<H2>16 February 1997</H2>
<UL>
<LI> SGI IRIX 6.2 has some problems with loadobj, some routines
	don't compile, and it cannot handle more than 5 expressions
	in e.g. snapprint. For one, I probably have to break down and make
	libnemo a shared library. <I> this has been solved in 2.4.0 </I>
<LI> Linux slackware3.1 (and possibly some other distributions too) may
	need <A HREF=ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/progs/nemo/gnumalloc.so>
	/lib/gnumalloc.so</A> to be linked in. There is a problem with
	the malloc/free in the standard libc (e.g. 5.3.12 is broken).
	You can look at my 
	<A HREF=ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/progs/nemo/cc>
	$NEMOBIN/cc</A> for linux (ELF) how i've solved this.
<LI> (TBA) Sellwood's 3D cartesian grid code is going to be incoorporated
	in NEMO. Thanks Jerry!

<LI> (22-oct) Release 2.3.7 with a fix to make linux (default is now ELF
	based, linux-aout present but not officially supported) work
	out of the box. sun5 (solaris) and sgi (irix 5.x) are also
	supported out of the box; all remaining OS may need some patch
	work. 
<LI> (22-oct) Old tar and patch files have been deleted. Only the
	current version (2.3.7) is present.

<LI> Support for the new ULTRA-Sparcs underway. So far only
     a fix to the hosttype script was needed (Solaris 2.5)

<LI> I'm playing with a <A HREF=nemo_new.html>new design NEMO homepage</A>;
	be careful, it is using some HTML3 features that may only be
	accessible through e.g. Netscape2
<LI> The <A HREF=lfa.html>Linux for Astronomy</A> CD-ROM is out, and 
	contains a copy of NEMO.
</UL>
<H2>15 December 1995 </H2>
For release 2.3.4:
<UL>
<LI> made the dynamic object loader work for OSF1 V3.2 (dec alpha)
	(should also work for SGI and LINUX, 
	but the next release will make this
	formal)
<LI> new command  '<B>ldso</B>' that aids dynamic object loading more
  portably accross architectures.
<LI> various minor bug fixed and features added, e.g.
    <UL>
    <LI> <b>mkop73</b>: fixed bug on solaris
    <LI> <b>snaprotate</b>: allowed more than 3 rotations
    <LI> <b>snapscale</b>: reporting
    <LI> <b>ccdmom</b>: new program to take moments on a cube (simple version)
    <LI> <b>fitstiff</b>
    <LI> <b>ccdfits, fitsccd</b>: resolved some WCS issued around the CTYPE's

<LI> The so-called portable random number generator from the Numerical
     Recepies library that NEMO uses is perhaps portable, but goes out
     of bounds a bit too often. Fixed by letting xrandom() spin until
     it's in range. This is part of release 2.3.3
<LI> loadobjDL.c will be patched to work with SGI IRIX 5.x (IRIX 4.x 
     is hopeless, I've given up on that now). IRIX 6.x to be confirmed.
     Not in release 2.3.3 yet.

<H2>22 July 1995 </H2>
<UL>
<LI> I've added a <A HREF=bugs.html> known bugs list</A>, of which eventually
     most will go into this whatsnew list.
<LI> NEMO Release 2.3 is out!
        <UL>
        <LI> Undoubtedly  there will be small patch (incremental tar) 
             files coming out. Such new versions will be versioned
             with patchlevels, e.g. nemo_2.3.11.tar.gz will be
             patchlevel 11, and would require you to load 11
             upgrades, or get the new tarfile.
             <UL>
             <LI> 5-jul-95 (2.3.1) bootstrap file upgraded, 
                    small manual and man pages were changed, versioning
		    through the user interface, nemoinp, tablsqfit
             <LI> 22-jul-95 (2.3.2) bug fix in snapslit, and Makefile 
                    support
		    for automated updating the anon.ftp area.
             <LI> 5-oct-95 (2.3.3) xrandom/ran3 bug fixed, added snapplotv
                    and ccdsharp
             </UL>
        <LI> If your site uses Solaris *with* a LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
             variable, check with your system mananger, or contact me
	     if you have trouble.
        <LI> I'm still working on the manual.

<LI> Release 2.3 is about to come out! From now on a release will have a version
consisting of major (2) and minor (3) version id, with patchlevels.
<LI> 26-may-95: too much time spent in HDF and FITSIO routines for
some of my own work. In addition something with -xcg92 compilation
broke on our solaris installation, and that needs to be tracked down
too. And some other fires.. Soooo, Release 2.3 won't be out until
mid june.

<LI> LINUX version is running, including 
<A HREF="man_html/loadobj.3.html"> loadobj </A>. Since PGPLOT has been
ported to LINUX, there is nothing holding official LINUX support
back now. I expect this new release (version 2.3) to be in mid february.
<LI> Although we have always had support for a single precision
NEMO, ANSI compiling with more strict rules has set me back
considerably. Until *everything* relevant has been properly
prototyped, compiling with -DSINGLEPREC is not recommended. I hope
to fix this soon, but not in release V2.3
<LI> Added some <A HREF=

utilities: 
<A HREF=man_html/tsd.1.html> tsd </A>,
<A HREF=man_html/fitssds.1.html> fitssds </A>,

<LI> We are now running NCSA's new 
<A HREF=http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html> httpd </A> (V1.3) 
server. This has a new powerful
server include mechanism, and lots of other goodies. There may be
some problems with the current info you are reading, since some files
had to be converted. We are running this server with the option that
(server include) parsing is only done when the execute bit of a file
is turned on. It seems that that the new <I> netscape </I> WWW browser
has some problems with this, but 
<A HREF=http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/web-index.html>
NCSA Mosaic </A> doesn't.

<LI> An <A href=nbody/index.html> Nbody Data Interchange Format </A>
     discussion group has been set up. This includes an email exploder
     (<I> nbody@astro.umd.edu </I>) and various archives of data in
    different formats and accompanying software.
<LI> An X-windows <a href=man_html/yapp.3.html> YAPP </a>
    (NEMO's graphics interface) has been installed. This software
    was written by Patrick Frisch, who has written a number of programs
    within the NEMO environment. (<i> pfrisch@walhall.uni-sw.gwdg.de </i>)
    You can 
    <a href=ftp://astro.umd.edu/pub/nemo/yapp_x.tar.gz>     
    pick up the patch file </a>
    (a compressed tarfile) from our
    anonymous ftp, and overload it on your current NEMO. Be aware, it
    also contains a NEW NEMORC startup file.
<LI> The ``public domain'' PLPLOT package (obtainable from
    <A HREF=ftp://dino.ph.utexas.edu/plplot> dino.ph.utexas.edu </A>) can now
    be used with a new YAPP device driver yapp_plplot.c.

<LI>
    The manual pages have now been converted using a patched up
    roff2html converter, and has links into the 
	<A HREF=http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/man/sunos.top.html>
    SunOS manual pages</A>, where appropriate.
    You can start at the

    seconds half of the man1 index </A> page.

<LI>
  The <A HREF="man/cat1/gaussfit.1"> gaussfit </A> program,
  for arbitrary least squares fitting
  and robust estimation, has been added with a NEMO interface.
<LI>
  <A HREF="man/cat1/snaprect.1"> snaprect </A> has been extended
  with more options to determine the shape of a potential, in
  addition it can determine the axial ratio profile.

<H2>12 June 1994 </H2>

<UL> 
<LI> A <A HREF=bootstrap> bootstrap </A> loader is supplied that takes
	away virtually all the work in installing NEMO. 
<LI> A <A HREF="nbody/questionnaire"> QUESTIONNAIRE </A> is available which
	will be used to design and prototype an interchange and archive
	format for particle simulation data. Please look at it, load it
	to your local disk (<B> Options/Load To Local Disk</B> in Xmosaic),
	fill in the blanks, and send me your copy by e-mail.
<LI> Added Quinn/Balcells conversion of their
    <A HREF="man/cat5/xvp.5"> xvp </A> format in the form of a sample
    <A HREF="man/cat1/xvpsnap.1"> xvpsnap </A> program. A few small
    mostly cosmetic (less verbosities, smaller <I>nmax</I>) were needed
    to relevant I/O subroutines.

<H2>10 May 1994 </H2>

<UL>
<LI> Couchman' cosmological N-body simulator is available in
     $NEMO/usr/couchman. NEMO wrappers for his programs
<A HREF="man/cat1/prun.1"> prun </A> and
<A HREF="man/cat1/pstart.1"> pstart </A> have been written.
In addition, this resulted in an experimential I/O library
with access to fortran unformatted binary files from C routines.
See the manual pages for
<A HREF="man/cat3/unfio.3"> unfio(3) </A> and
<A HREF="man/cat3/memio.3"> memio(3) </A>.

<LI> The <A HREF=tipsy/tipsy.html> TIPSY </A> package has been installed;
    the source code is 
    intended to reside in $NEMO/usr/tipsy. Documentation is still limited,
    but being worked on. 
<LI> A new version of 
   <A HREF=starlab/starlab.html> Starlab </A> has been installed. We upgraded
    from 1.0 to 1.1.1. We now follow the convention of directory names, so
   <I> $NEMO/usr/starlab/1.1.1 </I> will be the value of $STARLABPATH.

<H2>24 January 1994 </H2>

With Solaris 2.3 (SUN OS 5.3) now running on a local UMD test machine,
most of NEMO is now running. This includes a smooth running  
<A HREF="man/cat3/loadobj.3"> loadobj </A> package, as well as a 
<A HREF="man/cat3/yapp.3"> yapp </A> in X (this one thanks to 
<I> Patrick Frisch </I>).

<B> NOTE: </B> the export tar files have not been updated yet, as much
more proper testing is needed.

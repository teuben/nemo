tsf types the contents of a (binary) structured file (see
filestruct(5NEMO)) in a human readable form on standard output.  The
type, tag, dimensions (if any) and contents of all items are listed.
The contents of CharType items are printed directly; FloatType and
DoubleType items are printed in floating-point notation; all other
types are printed in octal for portability reasons (but see octal=
below).  XML format can optionally be selected as well, but this is
not been well exercised. A json mode has been considered.

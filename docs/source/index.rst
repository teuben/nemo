   \ddot{ {\bf r}}_i \, = \, -G \sum_{j=1;\, j \not = \,i}^N {m_j \,({\bf r}_i - {\bf r}_j)  \over {(r_{ij}^2 + \epsilon^2)^{3/2} } }


.. todo::  This manual was converted from the old latex based 
   *NEMO Users and Programmers Guide*, although not all sections
   have been included or fully converted yet.
	   
   Other online entry points for NEMO are:
   `github pages <https://teuben.github.io/nemo/>`_ and
   `github code <https://github.com/teuben/nemo>`_ .  We also keep an index to
   `(unix) man pages for all programs <https://teuben.github.io/nemo/man_html/index1.html>`_ and of course a
   `what's new <https://teuben.github.io/nemo/whatsnew.html>`_ .

   Although this manual should be on
   https://astronemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest
   we also keep a local copy 
   `readthedocs on astroumd <https://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/nemo/readthedocs/html>`_.

=================

Here we summarize some codes used in stellar dynamics that are similar to NEMO.
We only list codes that are (publically) available. SPH/hydro codes are currently
not included.   See also `ASCL <https://ascl.net>`_ to find more codes.

First we start off with some expanded examples on a few specific codes
that have a tighter connection to NEMO:

Categories
----------

Such a niche list of codes made me wonder what kind of meta-data we could use to
categorize such dynamics codes, but then perhaps along the lines of the
`Unified Astronomy Thesaurus <https://github.com/astrothesaurus>`_ project.

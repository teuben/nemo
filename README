This directory contains source code and documentation for NEMO, a
toolbox for stellar dynamics, particle simulations, image processing and
tabular data manipulation.

This is the 3rd major release of NEMO, and although data are compatible
with earlier releases, source code will generally need to be tweaked a
bit to compile and link in the newer releases. 

NEMO V1:	IAS release (Barnes, Hut & Teuben; appr. 1987)
NEMO V2:	UMD release (Teuben 1994)
NEMO V3:	UMD release (Teuben 2001) with autoconf support and
		hooks into manybody.org modules starlab and partiview

A related package, ZENO, was spun off NEMO V1, and is maintained 
by Barnes.

NEMO:  ascl:1010.051
ZENO:  ascl:1102.027

See README.install for installation guidelines.

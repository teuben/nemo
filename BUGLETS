- install on darwin:
	- FORLIBS get crt1.o or something, and this is not needed,
	and will cause linkers to fail. It needs to be removed
	from the $NEMOLIB/makedefs and NEMORC.local - if  present -

- install on solaris:
	awk cannot handle too many in src/scripts/need/
	exception.c does not compile for gcc3 as well as solaris' cc
	- FORLIBS needs the 
	  -R /opt/SUNWspro/lib -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lF77 -lM77 -lV77 -lsunmath 
	  type solution for pgplot, and if so,
	- FORLIBS need to be added to YAPPLIB


- filestruct:
  The following snippet of code stores only  "1" for the value of pi,
  3 times. ZENO actually does it correct.
    put_set(ostr,"par");
    pi = 1;
    put_data(ostr, "pi", DoubleType, &pi, 0);
    pi = 2;
    put_data(ostr, "pi", DoubleType, &pi, 0);
    pi = 3;
    put_data(ostr, "pi", DoubleType, &pi, 0);
    put_tes(ostr,"par");
  ZENO also reads correctly, and if no more 'same name' items are present,
  it will repeat the last one read. But the ZENO reader will serially
  read (and remember?)

- filestruct history: long character strings are broken in silly places,
	and don't port very well between tsf/rsf


- comment from Walter:

- compiling on some older linux versions will fail due to a prototype
  for dprintf() in /usr/include/stdio.h - you can comment out our
  version in $NEMOINC/stdinc.h and it will work
  Or add		-DHAVE_DPRINTF
  to CFLAGS (should add that to configure.in)
  THe official name is now nemo_dprintf, though internally
  dprintf will stay and #defined to nemo_configure

  still a linking problem on those cases left... (redhat 5.2)
	-ansi ?

- mktemp() should be converted mkstemp() in stropen.c (recent gcc compilers
  will complain about it, but it will work)
  Problem: can't get a fileno from a FILE * (the other way around
  is ok, use fileno()) so we're stuck....

* nbody0: some weird problems with some (all?) gcc 2.96's:
  e.g. gcc 2.96 20000731 (Linux-Mandrake 8.0 2.96-0.48mdk) 
	-O0 	is ok
	-g  	is ok
	-O1 	is bad
	-g -O2	is bad
  cd $NEMO/src/nbody/evolve/aarseth/nbody0
	make clean nbody00 OPT=-O0
	make -f Testfile clean all
  (this assumes you have a makedefs file with hacked OPT in it, not
  CFLAGS)

  gcc3.0 is ok again, as is 2.95.3

- solaris: still get -rdynamic in the link options, it works, but it
  does not look nice. this is for gcc, didn't try /opt/SUNSWpro yet

- Suse didn't resolve fortran binding to C too well for potentials
  (.so object files, e.g. athan92)

- sol8:  potlist does not built due to __powf missing....   (cc)
  need to manually adjust the $NEMOLIB/makedefs file and move the
  -lsunmath line to FORLIBS

- sgi: loadobjDL works for bodytrans, but not potentials....

potlist: rld: Fatal Error: attempted access to unresolvable symbol in
/home/starlab/nemo_3.0.6/obj/mips-sgi-irix6.5/potential/athan92.so: __powdi
  (some conceptual program? since sol8 seems to have the same problem)

  Also, for the SGI at sulfur.amnh.org (where there is some problem with
  the default f77 license) one needs to do

	setenv F77 f90

  before configure is run.  This is a "mips-sgi-irix6.5" machine.

- sgi:  hackforce does not compile/link

- -DSINGLEPREC:  scfm does not work
 		 athan92 shows some significant force differences

- sgi:  for 64 bit mode add
	 -mabi=64   (if gnu) ,or
	-64
  For 64 bit compilations.

- kawaii/nbody does not seem to work, neither in IONEMO mode, nor default I/O mode
  (at least on linux)

# Branches in NEMO

Here we record some (historic) information on branches. There are a
number of branches in NEMO, some of which can be deleted, some of
which have been abandoned. Nothing was ever documented.

The first thing each branch should do is document it's use, also
provided another easy to see point where branching occured. When the
branch is merged back, it should become part of the master.

History:

April 2004:	version 1 and 2.0 added via CVS
May 2025:       gcc14 prototype fixes - some comparison with the bhtree (BHTC) version


Benchmark notes:

If bhtree/BHTC is needed, the following recipe should work in the old-style amuse install

   mknemo amuse
   cd $NEMO/local/amuse
   ./configure
   pip install -e
   cd src/amuse/community/bhtree
   make clean
   make
   cp build/BHTC $NEMOBIN

The new style 2025 install probably uses something like

   ./setup developer bhtree

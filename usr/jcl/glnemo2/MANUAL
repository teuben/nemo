  Here is a brief introduction about how to use 'glnemo2' program.
  
  glnemo2 is a program with NEMO philosophy. 

If you start the command:

    glnemo2 help=h

you'll see all the possible command line parameters.
 
But glnemo2 is also an interactive program, so you can start it without 
command line parameters, just enter : glnemo2

 Glnemo2 can read different kind of file format and detect them automatically if they are
known.
Currently, glnemo2 reads:
- NEMO files (http://carma.astro.umd.edu/nemo)
- Gadget 1 and 2 -little and big endian- files (http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/)
- RAMSES files (http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html)
- TIPSY files (http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/tipsy/tipsy.html)
- FTM files (Clayton Heller's sph/nbody code)
- phiGRAPE file (http://wiki.cs.rit.edu/bin/view/GRAPEcluster/phiGRAPE)
- list of files stored in a file
- realtime gyrfalcON simulation via a network plugin

 From the command line you can select particles to load by specifying a range of particles, or
by the name of the component (if the file format store its data by component name).

 For example :

1) glnemo2 in=mysnaphot  select=0:199999,300000:999999

  it loads snapshot "mysnapshot" and creates 2 objects (range0: 0 to 199999 particles indexes)
 and (range1 : 300000 to 999999 particles indexes)

2) glnemo2 in=snap_01  select=gas,stars

 it loads snapshot "snap_01" and creates 2 objects (range0: gas particles) and
 (range1 : stars particles). Gas and stars particles are automatically detected from the
 input file.


If you start glnemo2 without feeding "select" parameter, it will open a dialog box where you
will be able to select particles.

 Once started, glnemo2 displays particles, and different actions with the mouse or the keyboard
perform different actions.

(note : 
LMB = Left Mouse Button
RMB = Right Mouse Button
A   = Alt key
C   = Control key
S   = Shift key

- To rotate: click left or right mouse button and move the
mouse (LMB or RMB)
  
- zoom  in/out : use the wheel mouse or 
                 press '+' or '-' keys or
                 C+S+LMB+ mouve mouse (fast zoom)

- to translate : C + LMB and move the mouse , translate on XY axis
                 C + RMB and move the mouse , translate on Z axis

- toggle grid : press g  (or click 'grid' icon)

- to reset rotation and translation press C+R (or click 'house' icon).

- to fit all the particles on screen press CTRL + A ( or click 'magnifying glass' icon).

- to take a snapshot : press s  ( or click 'camera' icon).

- to play all the snapshot time steps : press p or [space bar]( or click 'arrow" icon).

- to reload a snapshot : or click 'curly arrow" icon.

- to toggle fullscreen : press f ( or click 'squared + 4 red arrows' icon).

- to toggle auto-rotation around X axis : C+X

- to toggle auto-rotation around Y axis : C+Y

- to toggle auto-rotation around Z axis : C+Z

- toggle options : press o ( or click 'tools' icon)

   a tabbed dialog box appear and you can play with different options:
     
     *) Interactive select TAB
        ----------------------
	Allows to select particles using the mouse

	[selection mode] group box
        -> select and zoom : S + LMB, draw a rectangle area and zoom in
        -> select only     : S + LMB, draw a rectangle area without zooming
	In both cases, the number of particles selected in the rectangle area
        is reported.

     *) Play TAB
        --------
        Manage the loading of the different time steps

        [fps] spin box
	Loading frame rate

	[COM] check box
	Check it if you want that the snapshot be automatically centered according to
        the Center Of Mass at each new time step.

        [Play] button
        toggle on/off loading

     *) Auto-Screenshots TAB
        --------------------
        Manage the automatic screenshot feature

	[resolution] select list
        choose on which resolution you want the screenshot

        [format] radio group box
        choose output file format (JPG or PNG)

	[frame name] button
        click to open a dialog box to choose where to store screenshots

	[reset] button
        click to reset screenshot  index counter

        [Automatic shots] checkbox group
        if you enable "on GL events", a screenshot will be taken at each OpenGL events
        if you enable "on new frame", a screenshot will be taken at each new loading time
        step.

     *) Camera TAB
        ----------
        Partially implemented. Click on "start" button to fly over the simulation.

     *) Bench TAB
        ---------
        if you want to benchmark your video card, click on "start" button and you'll see
        the Frame Per Second rate in red color.

          
- Object settings : press r  ( or click 'color' icon)
     a dialog box appear which allows you to change the range of selected 
     particles and their colors (click on the color to change it, and a
     intuitive color dialog box appears to help you to select a new color).
    
     [range TAB]
     You can create a new object by giving a selected range. Do not forget to 
     "enter" to confirm the new object.

     [particles TAB]
     Each object has its own properties (texture size, particle size, color etc...). To
     control an object, click on the selected range.

     [density TAB]
     If the component selected has density data, the density TAB, allow to play with the
     threshold of density. You can see an histogram representing in Y axes, the log(#bodies)
     and X axis the log(density). If you move the density threshold slides, don't forget to click
     on "apply" button. 
     You can change the density colormap by entering Alt+Shift+N (next colormap), 
     and Alt+Shift+P (previous colormap).
     You can toggle between absolute colormap and relative colormap according to threshold value,
     for that enter Alt+Shift+C

     [orbits TAB]
     If you have a snapshot with multiple time steps, you can plot the orbits of some particles.
     Check record (to record orbits), check diplay to see the orbits. Max orbits is the number of
     orbits you want to track. Max time history, it's the number of time steps you want to record.
     Once this done, click on play button or "p" to load all the time steps.



 If there are many time steps in the snapshot, press 'p' (or click 'arrow' icon) to
 load them successively.

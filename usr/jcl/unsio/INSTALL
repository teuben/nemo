0) Website
===========

UNSIO has 

- a dedicated website : http://projets.lam.fr/projects/unsio

- a wiki              : http://projets.lam.fr/projects/unsio/wiki


I) REQUIREMENTS
===============

Unsio compile fine on Linux and MacOSX. You just need a recent
gcc/g++ compiler and cmake tools (version 2.6). Cmake tools can be
installed directly from your distribution or downloaded from here :
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

II) CONFIGURATION
=================

To configure UNSIO, type

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

 You can add several options to command "cmake". The most important ones are

  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>          installation directory [${NEMO}]
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release>    build type [Debug]
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=<TRUE|FALSE>      shared or static libraries [TRUE]

Here is different scenarios :

1) default configuration (no options added)
-------------------------------------------
mkdir build-debug
cd build-debug
cmake ..

Will configure unsio in "debug" mode, with shared library and
installation path will be
  a) in ${NEMO} if NEMO package is installed and loaded
  b) if not NEMO installed nor loaded, it will install to ${HOME}/local/unsio

2) you specify your own installation path
------------------------------------------
mkdir build-test
cd build_test
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/mypath/toinstall"

Will configure unsio in "debug" mode, with shared library and
installation path to "/mypath/toinstall"

3) you want compile in release mode (with optimizations enabled)
----------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir build-release
cd build-release  
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 

Will configure unsio in "release" mode with shared library and
installation path will be
  a) in ${NEMO} if NEMO package is installed and loaded
  b) if not NEMO installed nor loaded, it will install to ${HOME}/local/unsio

4) so forth and so on.....


Note that CMake maintains a cache name "CMakeCache.txt". If you change options
(or your environment changes), it is best to remove that file to avoid
problems.


III) BUILDING
==============

To build UNSIO libraries, type

  make    

If you want, you can install UNSIO headers and libraries. To do so, type

  make install


A list of all available make targets can be obtained by

  make help


IV) Mac OSX
============

 Under Mac OSX platform, once installed unsio, you have to set environement DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to UNSIO installed location path

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=_UNSIOPATH_/lib

where _UNSIOPATH_ matches to UNSIO installed location path

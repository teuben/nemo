The AGAMA library is a collection of tools for constructing and
analyzing models of galaxies. It computes gravitational potential and
forces, performs orbit integration and analysis, and can convert
between position/velocity and action/angle coordinates. It offers a
framework for finding best-fit parameters of a model from data and
self-consistent multi-component galaxy models, and contains useful
auxiliary utilities such as various mathematical routines. The core of
the library is written in C++, and there are Python and Fortran
interfaces. AGAMA may be used as a plugin for the stellar-dynamical
software packages galpy (ascl:1411.008), AMUSE (ascl:1107.007), and
NEMO (ascl:1010.051).

The examples in the Makefile cover the section "Nemo plugin" in the
AGAMA reference guide (Vasiliev, -2025)

#   - this needs GSL ;  libgsl-dev
#   - needs EIGEN   libeigen3-dev didn't do it
#   - needs CVXOPT  python3-cvxopt    or:   pip install cvxopt
#   - needs UNSIO - but my previous pip install didn't work
#   - GLPK library (optional) is not found, ignored  -  libglpk-dev

The AGAMA library is a collection of tools for constructing and
analyzing models of galaxies. It computes gravitational potential and
forces, performs orbit integration and analysis, and can convert
between position/velocity and action/angle coordinates. It offers a
framework for finding best-fit parameters of a model from data and
self-consistent multi-component galaxy models, and contains useful
auxiliary utilities such as various mathematical routines. The core of
the library is written in C++, and there are Python and Fortran
interfaces. AGAMA may be used as a plugin for the stellar-dynamical
software packages galpy (ascl:1411.008), AMUSE (ascl:1107.007), and
NEMO (ascl:1010.051).

The examples in the Makefile cover the section "Nemo plugin" in the
AGAMA reference guide (Vasiliev, -2025)

- this needs GSL ;  libgsl-dev
- needs EIGEN   libeigen3-dev didn't do it
- needs CVXOPT  python3-cvxopt    or:   pip install cvxopt
- needs UNSIO - but my previous pip install didn't work
- GLPK library (optional) is not found, ignored  -  libglpk-dev 


## Benchmark

The command `make test1` runs a benchmark, also performs a BSF regression test:

          BSF: OK     -0.115841 1.03215 -33.2085 50 70001 -

The test1 also report a CPU, but laptops with thermal protection may show
different CPU times between different runs.

- I5-10210U :      28.9 sec
- Ultra 7 155H :   15.9
- i9-12900K :      13.7

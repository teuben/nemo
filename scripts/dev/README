The name of this directory "csh" is a misnomer, they are examples in
a variety of shells by now: csh, (ba)sh and python

See also the templates directory for simple examples of scripts with
a variety of CLI/GUI interfaces to choose from.

Lastly, be careful using the older scripts, they have not been
re-vetted.

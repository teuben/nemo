  Purpose:

    MAIN is the main program for HEATED_PLATE_OPENMP.

  Discussion:

    This code solves the steady state heat equation on a rectangular region.

    The sequential version of this program needs approximately
    18/epsilon iterations to complete. 


    The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
    by this diagram;

                   W = 0
             +------------------+
             |                  |
    W = 100  |                  | W = 100
             |                  |
             +------------------+
                   W = 100

    The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
    array W is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
    array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
    indices of the four corners:

                  I = 0
          [0][0]-------------[0][N-1]
             |                  |
      J = 0  |                  |  J = N-1
             |                  |
        [M-1][0]-----------[M-1][N-1]
                  I = M-1

    The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
    following condition at an interior grid point:

      W[Central] = (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )

    where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
    of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.
   
    Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
    "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
    average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
    as an ASSIGNMENT statement:

      W[Central]  <=  (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )

    If this process is repeated often enough, the difference between successive 
    estimates of the solution will go to zero.

    This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
    the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
    be used for graphic processing.

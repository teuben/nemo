November 1997:	imported "as is" from SJA with one important change:
		Sverre's "Makefile" is "Makefile.sja"
		Nemo's Makefile is	Makefile.nemo
			(so you can clean, nmax, etc.etc.)
		Makefile itself is now a symlink to Makefile.nemo

6-mar-98	added call to VERIFY in input.f

feb-2019:       added KZ(15)=1 to mean using code units for tcrit/deltat

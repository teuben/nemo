This is NBODY0, more or less as published in Binney and Tremaine (1987).
The minor deviations from BT87 are listed in the source code, nbody0.f

It has an optional NEMO I/O interface, as explained in the
Makefile.  One can also use the vanilla Fortran version, in which case
the NEMO library is not needed to complete linking.  Hernquist' ascii
205 format (see NEMO programs atos and stoa to convert from/to
snapshots) is then used to store snapshots.

A manual page, nbody0.1, is available which explains the NEMO user
interface part. It normally lives in $NEMO/man/man1, but a local
copy is kept here, as well as an ascii formatted version of the manual
page.

A pure C version of the compute engine is also available under the name
nbody00.c  It may run a little faster or slower then the fortran
version (during development on my sparc-1 C was about about 10% slower
than fortran).  The C version was generated with the public
domain program 'f2c', and subsequently hand edited to optimize and
improve readability.

Later additions:

(jan-2000) The fortran-C interfaces have been converted to F77_FUNC macros, for which
           you need NEMO.
(feb-2004) Added an option to do better timestep control (e.g. for figure8 orbit)

(sep-2018) Loaded ftp://ftp.ast.cam.ac.uk/pub/sverre/nbody0/nbody0.f as nbody0_sja.f
           Described as "Compact fourth-order Hermite block-step code."

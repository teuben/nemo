.SH NAME
index \- index processor for converting LaTeX idx files
.SH ORIGIN
TRW
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B index [ -l ]
.B [ -f
.I alphabetizefile
.B ] [
.I file...
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Index
converts 
.I idx 
files generated by \*(LX into 
.I theindex 
environments that can be processed by \*(LX.
Multiple files may be given.
If the file is not found, the extension
.I idx
is appended and the new file is looked for.
Index files will be created with the extension
.I ind.
If no files are given, standard input is read and standard output it written.
Subitems and subsubitems can be generated by separating index entries
with commas.
For example, after running your document
through \*(LX you may obtain an index file 
.I sample.idx
containing entries
that look like
.RS
.nf
\eindexentry{Reagan}{32}
\eindexentry{Reagan}{54}
\eindexentry{Reagan,republicans}{54}
\eindexentry{Carter}{60}
\eindexentry{Reagan,republicans,conventions}{62}
.fi
.RE
After running the index file through
.I index
a file
.I sample.ind 
will be created that will contain
.RS
.nf
\ebegin{theindex}
\eitem Carter 60
\eindexspace 
\eitem Reagan 32, 54
  \esubitem republicans 54
    \esubsubitem conventions 62
\eend{theindex}
.fi
.RE
The 
.I indexspace 
leaves a little extra vertical space between the entries that start with
a new letter.
If the 
.I -l 
option is given, then a large index letter will precede each entry
that starts with a new letter.
.PP
.I Index
reads the file
.I .alphabetize
in the home directory if it exists
to determine how to alphabetize an
.I idx
file.
This file contains rules for skipping control sequences, characters, etc
when alphabetizing a file.
The format of this file is described in
.IR index (5).
If the 
.I -f 
option is given, then another alphabetization file can be given.
.PP
A dash following an entry indicates the beginning of a range. 
The range is ended by the occurence of the next equivalent entry.
For example, suppose you had a \*(LX file containing
.RS
.nf
\&...and they fought\eindex{fighting-} and wept...
.fi
.RE
on page 40 and
.RS
.nf
\&...and were still fighting\eindex{fighting} years later...
.fi
.RE 
on page 42 with no intervening
.I \eindex
commands.
Then after running the 
.I idx
file through 
.I index,
the line 
.RS
.nf
\eitem fighting 40--42
.fi
.RE 
would be contained in the 
.I ind 
file.
When ranges are given for subitems and subsubitems, only the last
comma separated entry should have a dash suffix.
Duplicate page numbers are suppressed.
.PP
If you wish to insert a comma into your index entry, you will need to 
hide it from the index processor with braces
since only outer level commas are recognized as item delimeters.
For example,
.RS
.nf
\eindex{Reagan{,} Ronald}
.fi
.RE
generates the index entry for
.I Reagan, Ronald.

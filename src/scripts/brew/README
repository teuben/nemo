We keep a list of the "formula" that should be installed for NEMO,
although there are probably a few more than needed

Version 3 of homebrew does not support pgplot, because of the obscure caltech license.
In this case the "mknemo pgplot" to install a local source code based may work, as
well as giza (mknemo giza,   reconfigure --with-yapp=giza)

Another option is to use brew install kazuakiyama/pgplot/pgplot

Some other comments:

- The (Lecar 1968) iau25 problem is an Nbody problem.
  The Tolman solution (Tolman 1934 - Proceedings of the National Academy of
     Sciences of the United States of America, 20, 169)
  is an analytical solution of the collapse of a hom sphere.
  Weinberg (1972) also discusses this in his textbook.

  creates table of time and radius of this sphere as it collapses.
  This is based on R_0=1 density_0=pi and G=1

  Contopolous, in his 2004 Scientific Autobiography, comments on the optimism of Lecar when
  different integrators would find anywhere from 1 to 5 escaping stars in this simulation.
  He decided the number of escapers was 3 plus or minus 2!

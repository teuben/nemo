Some other comments:

- The (Lecar 1968) iau25 problem is an Nbody problem, albeit a very difficult one.
  The Tolman solution (Tolman 1934 - Proceedings of the National Academy of
     Sciences of the United States of America, 20, 169)
  is an analytical solution of the collapse of a homogeneous sphere.
  Weinberg (1972) also discusses this in his textbook.
  See also http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5102v1 (Schaller et al. 2013)

  nemoinp 0:pi:0.001 | tabmath - - "(%1+sin(%1))/(2*pi*sqrt(8/3)),0.5*(1+cos(%1))" all > iau25-tr.tab

  creates table of time and radius of this sphere as it collapses.
  This is based on R_0=1 density_0=pi and G=1

  Contopolous, in his 2004 Scientific Autobiography, comments on the optimism of Lecar when
  different integrators would find anywhere from 1 to 5 escaping stars in this simulation.
  He decided the number of escapers was 3 plus or minus 2!

- the JPL (Picket et al. 1998) catalogue used by tabpp can be installed with the script
  $NEMO/src/scripts/get_jplcatalog

- Intel is little endian, (bytes "92 0b" are the first two), where big endian are "0b 92".
  NEMO will swap bytes if a file doesn't have the native byteswap, but otherwise NEMO
  will not swap bytes natively.
      mkplummer - 10 | hexdump -C | head
  is the native data format.

- some interesting small Nbody systems

  - figure8 - 3 stars on a figure 8 orbit (Montgomery)
  - pyth - 3 stars at rest on a 3-4-5 pythagoran triangle. very difficult
  - star_of_david - two double stars tracing a star of david (Robert Vanderbei)

   mpv files are simple ASCII files and are converted to NEMO format as follows:
       
    tabtos in= out= header=nbody,time block1=mass,x,y,z,vx,vy,vz

NEMO command line arguments do not need to be given if given in the correct order.
For example:
	mkplummer out=p10 nbody=10
can be 
	mkplummer p10 10

If you want to find out the order of the keywords, use the "help=" option
or the multi-line "help=h"
%
Each NEMO program should have a Unix style manual page, but the --man command line argument
will also call this man page
        man mkplummer
	mkplummer --man
As well as
   	apropos plummer
%
A unix pipe becomes a '-' in NEMO:

	mkplummer - 10 | tsf -

where the first '-' denotes 'stdout', and the second 'stdin'.
%
The unix /dev/null as a "sink" becomes a '.' in NEMO, for example

        mkplummer . 10

%
Numbered file descriptors can also be used in NEMO, but only sh shells
(such as bash) support these, csh like shells do not. Example:

	mkplummer p1 10
	mkplummer p2 10
	snapstack -3 -4 junk 3<p1 4<p2

but remember that 0,1, and 2 are reserved for stdin, stdout and stderr.
This scheme makes it possible to write much more complex pipes and tee's
than the usual simple shell examples one sees.

The "redir" command (if installed) can also be useful.
%
A nemo file can also be a URL, e.g.

	tsf http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo/p10k.dat

In addition to this, files can also be "-"  (in a pipe, either read or write)
or a "."  (a /dev/null type sink)
%
There are two kinds on help:
Online help:		man mkplummer
Inline help:		mkplummer help=h

and there is no guarentee they are in sync.  We have a script "checkpars.py"
that checks if they are in sync.
%
The 'mknemo' command makes a very easy to recompile, or even update your
NEMO with new programs.
	mknemo 

For complicated procedures, the mknemo command uses a control file in
$NEMO/src/scripts/mknemo.d. E.g.
	mknemo gyrfalcON

The -u flag will update ("git pull") your NEMO before the program is
recompiled. The -a flag will also search in $NEMO/usr.
See -h for other options.
%
The template script generates a new NEMO template program from scratch
	
%
The yapp= system keyword selects for programs that need a graphics output
which graphics device/name is used. However, the yapp library is selected
during the installation, and this limits the format of the yapp= keyword

The most popular one is PGPLOT, where selections between postscript, X window
and PNG are common choices, e.g.
      yapp=fig1.ps/vps
      yapp=fig1.png/png
      yapp=10/xs

glnemo2 is a program originally developed for NEMO to view a simulation in 3D.
Although you can compile it from scratch, it's easier to download the binaries

A recent tutorial is here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfkfxvcYcX0
%
If you get a "PROG: command not found" error message on a supposedly< NEMO command,
the command
      mknemo PROG
should compile and make PROG available.

To see which packages were installed with mknemo, see the file $NEMO/opt/mknemo.log

To get a nice PDF output of a manual page, do:
    cd $NEMO/man
    ./manpdf man1/mkplummer.1
    xdg-open man1/mkplummer.1.pdf

%
To select rows from an ascii table, select by row number using tabrows,
or a range of X values using e.g. tabmath selfie=range(%1,$xmin,$xmax)
%
the bsf program computes some statistics of floating point numbers in a 
binary structured file, which can be used in benchmarking and regression. Example
     mkplummer - 128 seed=123 | bsf -
     BSF: 0.00111483 0.713141 -6.56685 5.72763 897 -
